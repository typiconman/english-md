Also on The 15th Day of the Month of June

Commemoration of Our Venerable Father

Jerome the Blessed, of Stridon

At Great Vespers

After the Introductory Psalm, we chant “Blessed is the man…”, the first antiphon.

On “Lord, I have cried…”, we chant 6 stichera: 3 in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: “Joy of the ranks of heaven…” —

Having been vouchsafed heavenly blessedness, the venerable Jerome, possessed of heavenly intelligence, prayeth with boldness to the one King of all in behalf of us who piously celebrate his memory.

Adorned on the day of thine honorable memorial, O father Jerome, we, the choirs of monastics, offer thee hymnody, asking thine intercession, whereof do thou not deprive us who honor thee with love.

Knowing thee to be a treasury of divinely wise doctrine and a treasury of exalted insight, we cry aloud unto thee: Rejoice, O inhabitant of the city of God, who sharest the lot of the all-wise preachers and the venerable who shone forth in ascetic feats.

And 3 stichera, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast given a sign…” —

Thou didst offer to thy Creator, O venerable one, uprightness of mind, purity, abstinence, concentrated prayer, the outpouring of tears, for whose sake thou hast been vouchsafed to behold the glory of God, upon which His most excellent servants gaze, and to sing the thrice-holy hymn, which is chanted in heaven by the angels, O divinely wise Jerome.

Taking the cross upon thy shoulder, and valiantly enduring tribulations, thou wast well-pleasing unto God; and thou didst lead to Him a multitude of virgins, in that thou art the adornment of the venerable, the receptacle of the divine Spirit. Wherefore we, the faithful, celebrate thy yearly memorial, asking thine aid.

Glorious Bethlehem, the city wherein the Lord was born in the flesh, received thy labors and the sweat of thine ascetic feats; and therein did thy repose take place, O divinely wise one. And, wholly illumined, O Jerome, thou hast taken thy stand in gladness before the Judge of the contest, the Savior of the world, entreating Him in our behalf.

Glory…, in Tone II —

Truly desiring the wisdom of God, thou didst diligently heed the words of the great Gregory, the rhetor and theologian; and thus learning that which was divine, thou didst struggle well, O venerable father, and to all thou wast shown to be honorable and pleasing unto Christ, as His sincere servant. Cease thou never to beseech Him in behalf of those who with faith and love cherish thine honored memory.

Now & ever…: Dogmatic theotokion, in the same tone —

The shadow of the law passed away when grace arrived; for, as the bush wrapped in flame did not burn, so the Virgin gave birth and yet remained a Virgin. In place of the pillar of fire, the Sun of righteousness hath shone forth. Instead of Moses, Christ is come, the Salvation of our souls.

Entrance. Prokimenon of the day. Three Readings:

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

The righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the Most High. Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with his right hand shall He cover them, and with His arm shall He protect them. He shall take to Him His jealousy for complete armor, and make the creature His weapon for the revenge of His enemies. He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment for an invincible shield. His severe wrath shall He sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with Him against the unwise. Then shall the right-aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and from the clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they be cast as out of a stone bow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them. Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty. Hear, therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations. For power is given you by the Lord, and sovereignty from the Most High.

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath He tried them and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. Those who put their trust in Him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with Him: for grace and mercy is to His saints, and He hath care for His elect.

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

Though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. For honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him: so that living among sinners he was translated. Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind. He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time: for his soul pleased the Lord; therefore hasted He to take him away from among the wicked. This the people saw, and understood not, neither laid they up this in their minds: that His grace and mercy is with His saints, and that He hath respect unto His chosen.

At the Aposticha, these stichera, in Tone V: Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice…” —

Rejoice, O pure intelligence, who received the effulgence of God, imparting it to the faithful who honor thy holy memory, O wise Jerome. For by thy most wise writings, O venerable one, thou movest all the intelligent to the praise of God, as a skillful teacher of the Christian people and their unshakable confirmation.

*Stichos:* Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

Rejoice, thou who wast made steadfast by the fear of God, for thereby thou didst come to recognize wisdom divine, and with love and loving-kindness didst make thyself thy Creator’s own, O Jerome, as one full of divine understanding, virtue and zeal. Wherefore, O all-blessed one, by thy supplications to the Lord free those who hymn thee from all want and sorrow.

*Stichos:* Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; in His commandments shall he greatly delight.

Rejoice, O goodly scion of Dalmatia, who wast nurtured in holiness in the Holy Land, and who lived for many years in ascetic struggles, which thou didst undertake, laying waste to thyself. Wherefore, thou now rightly dwellest in heaven, full of glory, as an initiate of the divine mysteries and an heir to the kingdom of Christ.

Glory…, in Tone VI —

Though a lover of secular wisdom, thou wast vouchsafed that which was greater and higher than it, O right glorious Jerome. Wherefore, when thou didst achieve excellence in both, thy God-pleasing life was recognized by all; for thy victories over the adversary proclaim thee a child of the light and a favorite of Christ, the Bestower of light, Who by thy supplications granteth enlightenment, peace and great mercy to our souls.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone —

O Theotokos, thou art the true vine which hath budded forth for us the Fruit of life. Beseech Him with the holy apostles, we pray thee, O Mistress, that He have mercy upon our souls.

Troparion, in Tone III —

The assembly of the Orthodox hath thee as a great intercessor, O divinely wise one, for as thou art a converser with the venerable and sharest in wisdom divine, so, O all-wondrous Jerome, entreat Christ God that He grant us great mercy.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone —

We hymn thee who hast mediated the salvation of our race, O Virgin Theotokos; for thy Son and our God, accepting suffering on the Cross in the flesh He had received of thee, hath delivered us from corruption, in that He loveth mankind.

Having been taught well by the divinely wise Gregory, in holiness the most excellent Jerome hastened from the West to the East; and having struggled in God-pleasing manner, he now prayeth to the Savior for us who celebrate his glorious memory, which we honor with faith.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

We all know thee to be the Mother of God, who wast truly shown to be a Virgin even after giving birth; and with love we have recourse unto thy goodness. For thee do we sinners have as an intercessor; thee have we acquired as our salvation amid perils: the only most immaculate one.

After the second chanting of the Psalter, this sessional hymn, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast appeared…” —

For the faithful thy sacred and splendid memorial hath arrived today, O venerable father, enlightening the souls of those who honor thee, O wise Jerome.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O blessed one, thou restoration of men, thou didst conceive when the most Holy Spirit, Who is equally enthroned and consubstantial with the Father, came upon thee, and the archangel spake.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

Joseph marvelled, beholding that which transcended nature, and thy seedless conception reminded him of the rain upon the fleece, the bush which burned with fire without being consumed, and the rod of Aaron which budded forth. And thy betrothed and protector cried aloud to the priests: “The Virgin giveth birth, yet remaineth a virgin even after birthgiving!”

The Lord said to His disciples: “All things are delivered unto Me of My Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him. Come unto Me, all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.”

After Psalm 50, this sticheron, in Tone VI —

O venerable father, God-bearing Jerome, initiate of the mysteries of Christ, who knowest ineffable things, most skillful guide of the Orthodox: Cease thou never to pray for us who celebrate thy memory with love.

*Stichos:* What shall I render unto the Lord for all that He hath rendered unto me?

Epistle to the Galatians, § 213

\(Gal. 5: 22-6: 2\)

Brethren, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

Alleluia, in Tone VI —

*Stichos:* Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; in His commandments shall he greatly delight.

Gospel according to Matthew, § 10

\[Mt. 4: 25-5: 12\]

At that time there followed Jesus great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan. And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain: and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.”

Communion Verse —

In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings.
