The 10th Day of the Month of June

Commemoration of the Holy Hierarch John Maximovich, Metropolitan of Tobolsk

At Great Vespers

After the Introductory Psalm, we chant “Blessed is the man…”, the first antiphon.

On “Lord, I have cried…”, 8 stichera, in Tone IV —

Let the land of Siberia rejoice today, for the all-radiant day of the commemoration of the great hierarch and wonderworker John hath arrived! And let all the inhabitants of that land be glad, possessing the holy and much-healing relics of the glorious favorite of God! Let the mountains and hills, the deserts and valleys of Siberia rejoice, praising the Lord Who hath given us a good pastor who prayeth unceasingly for the salvation of our souls. *Twice*

O great hierarch and wonderworker John, on the day of thy festival look down with mercy upon thy spiritual children who have gathered together to pray. By thy supplications grant us healing of body and salvation of soul, that, strengthened by thine intercession before God, we may with boldness glorify the Lord Who hath given us such a holy hierarch and worker of miracles, who prayeth continually for the salvation of our souls. *Twice*

To thee, O honored father, do we flee on the day of thy solemnity; and, falling down before thee, we pray to thee: Help us to bear the cross of our earthly life with courage, to render praise unto the Lord for His divine visitations, to live virtuously in peace and repentance, and to praise thee, O favorite of God, as a tireless advocate for the salvation of our souls. *Twice*

Standing today before the shrine of the relics of John, the holy hierarch of Tobolsk, O ye Orthodox people, let us all cry out unto him with compunction: O great ascetic of Siberia, forget not thy children, who have recourse unto thee amid their infirmities and tribulations, and who with faith ask thy help, in that thou prayest unceasingly for the salvation of our souls.

The prayer of a righteous man is of great effect. Gazing at the precious shrine of the relics of the holy hierarch John, let us with boldness and hope begin to call upon the Lord, that He may accept the supplication which the great hierarch maketh for us sinners, and that He grant salvation to our souls.

Glory…, in Tone VII —

Let us all praise the holy hierarch of Tobolsk, the adornment of hierarchs and ornament of monastics, the true lover of the word of God, the wise guide and ascetic, the good archpastor who loved the poor, who finished his hierarchal course in the land of Siberia, and by his blessed end revealed his holiness. And praising him today, let us say: O great advocate, cease thou never to cry out to the Lord for us, that in His great mercy He may set us firmly upon the path which leadeth to eternal salvation.

Now & ever…: Dogmatic theotokion, in the same tone —

In His love for mankind, the King of heaven appeared on earth and dwelt among men; for He Who received flesh from the pure Virgin and came forth from her having received human nature, is the only Son of God, two in nature but not hypostasis. Therefore, proclaiming Him to be truly perfect God and perfect man, we confess Christ our God. Him do thou beseech, O Mother unwedded, that our souls find mercy!

Entrance. Prokimenon of the day. Three Readings:

A Reading from Proverbs

The memory of the just is praised, and the blessing of the Lord is upon his head. Blessed is the man who hath found wisdom, and the mortal who knoweth prudence. For it is better to traffic for her, than for treasures of gold and silver. And she is more valuable than precious stones: no precious thing is equal to her in value. For length of existence and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and glory: out of her mouth righteousness proceedeth, and she carrieth law and mercy upon her tongue. Hearken to me, O children, for I will speak solemn truths. Blessed is the man who shall keep my ways; for my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and in them is prepared favor from the Lord. Ye, O men, do I exhort; and utter my voice to the sons of men. I, wisdom, have built up; upon counsel, knowledge and understanding have I called. Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and strength is mine. I love those that love me; those who seek me shall find grace. O ye simple, understand subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge. Hearken unto me again; for I will speak solemn truths. For my throat shall meditate truth; and false lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or perverse. They are all evident to those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge. For I will instruct you in truth, that your hope may be in the Lord, and ye may be filled with the Spirit.

A Reading from Proverbs

The mouth of the righteous droppeth wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall perish. The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse. False balances are an abomination before the Lord: but a just weight is acceptable unto Him. Wherever pride entereth, there will also disgrace: but the mouth of the humble doth meditate wisdom. The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the overthrow of the rebellious shall spoil them. Possessions shall not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness will deliver from death. When a just man dieth, he leaveth regret: but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and causeth joy. Righteousness traceth out blameless paths: but ungodliness encountereth unjust dealing. The righteousness of upright men delivereth them: but transgressors are caught in their own destruction. At the death of a just man his hope doth not perish: but the boast of the ungodly perisheth. A righteous man escapeth from a snare, and the ungodly man is delivered up in his place. In the mouth of ungodly men is a snare for citizens: but the understanding of righteous men is prosperous. In the prosperity of righteous men a city prospereth, but at the destruction of the wicked there is exultation. At the blessing of the upright a city shall be exalted, but by the mouths of ungodly men it is overthrown. A man void of understanding sneereth at his fellow citizens: but a sensible man is quiet.

Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon.

When the righteous is praised, the people will rejoice; for his memory is immortality, because it is known with God, and with men; for his soul pleased the Lord. Love wisdom, therefore, O men, and live; desire her, and ye shall be instructed. For the beginning of her is love and the observation of the law. Honor wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore. I will tell you, and will not hide from you the mysteries of God, for he it is who is the instructor of wisdom, the director of the wise, the master of all understanding and activity. And wisdom teacheth all understanding; for in her is a spirit understanding and holy, the brightness of the everlasting light, and the image of the goodness of God. She maketh friends of God, and prophets; she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the constellations of the stars; compared with the light, she is found preëminent. She hath delivered from pain those who please her, and guided them in right paths, given them knowledge of holy things, defended them from their enemies, and given them a mighty struggle, that they might all know that godliness is stronger than all; vice shall never prevail against wisdom, neither shall judgment pass away without convicting the evil. For they said to themselves, reasoning unrighteously: Let us oppress the righteous man, let us not spare his holiness, neither need we be ashamed of the ancient gray hairs of the aged, for our strength shall be a law unto us; let us lie in wait for the righteous, for he is displeasing to us, opposeth our doings, upbraideth us with our offending the law, and denounceth to our infamy the transgressions of our training. He professeth to have the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the child of the Lord. He is become a reproof to our thoughts, and is grievous even for us to behold; for his life is not like other men’s, his ways are of another fashion. We are accounted by him as a mockery, and he avoideth our ways as filth, and pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed. Let us see if his words be true; let us test what things happen to him. Let us examine him with mockery and torture, that we may know his meekness and prove his forbearance. Let us condemn him with a shameful death, for by his own words shall he be visited. Such things did they imagine, and were deceived; for their own wickedness blinded them. As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not; neither bethought they that Thou alone art God, who hast the power of life and death, savest in time of tribulation, and deliverest from all evil; who art compassionate and merciful, givest grace to Thy saints and opposest the prideful with Thine own arm.

At Litia, these stichera, in Tone I —

Rejoice, ye peoples of Siberia! Join in festival, ye who love the great bishop of Tobolsk! For, lo! having first taken up the struggle of monasticism and the hierarchal ministry in Little Russia, at the end of his life he hastened to cold Siberia, bringing thither the great wisdom of his eldership, and received there his blessed end. Wherefore, the Lord hath glorified him, enriched him with the gift of miracles, and preserved his body incorrupt.

Thou art the glory of Chernigov and Tobolsk, O most honorable hierarch; thou wast the successor of the holy hierarch Theodosius of Chernigov, who loved thee and gave thee healing when thou wast ill; thou wast an emulator of Innocent, the great apostle of Siberia, and of the humble-minded Sophronius; thou art a lamp set upon the mountain of Tobolsk, that we all might strive to emulate thy holy life, that the name of our heavenly Father may be glorified by us all.

The Lord, Who is wondrous in His saints, hath in thee provided us with a model of humility and meekness, the forgiveness of all and the love of the poor. O brethren, let us love these great virtues, that the Lord may grant us a painless Christian end and an everlasting inheritance with all the saints.

Glory…, in Tone III —

The southern parts of Holy Russia and its northern reaches boast of thy holy life; thy great love for God and the people is shown forth; thy wisdom in the pastoral leadership of thy flock is impressed upon their hearts and souls like a seal; and thy struggle of unceasing prayer moveth all of us to emulation. O great favorite of Christ, make those who love thee to be zealous observers of the law of Christ, that we may all receive mercy and find grace as our timely aid.

Now & ever…: Theotokion —

Through the divine Spirit, by the will of the Father, without seed thou didst conceive the Son of God Who hath existed without mother from before the ages, and for our sake thou gavest birth in the flesh unto Him Who came forth from thee without father; and thou didst nurture Him on milk as a babe. Wherefore, cease not to pray, that our souls be delivered from tribulations.

At the aposticha, these stichera, in Tone V —

Rejoice, O holy hierarch, father John, guardian of the land of Siberia, mighty hope of those who pray to thee. O thou who healest the sick without fee, feeder of the poor, wise guide of all Christians! Be thou for us all an invincible helper and an advocate for all the world.

*Stichos:* The righteous man shall flourish like a palm-tree, and like a cedar in Lebanon shall he be multiplied.

Rejoice, O thou who wast reared in the Caves, good and spiritual teacher of youths, ascetic of the land of Chernigov, like unto the holy hierarch Theodosius, superior of the Monastery of Yeletsk, and good archpastor of Chernigov! Cease thou never to pray for all who flee to thine aid.

*Stichos:* The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be broken.

Rejoice, splendid model of the monastic life, rule of prayer, eye which sleepeth not, converser with angels, instructive pastor, who lookest down upon the flock from heaven! Pray thou to the Lord, that our souls may find mercy.

Glory…, in Tone VIII —

O John, holy hierarch of Christ, advocate for ice-bound Siberia, insuperable bulwark of the city of Tobolsk, gracious guardian of the land of Russia, who sharest the lot of the venerable and the righteous, O boast of hierarchs: Forget not thy children, and pray thou to the Lord, that He grant us great mercy.

Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O unwedded Virgin who ineffably conceived God in the flesh, Mother of God Most High: Accept the entreaties of thy servants, O most immaculate one, granting unto all cleansing of transgressions; and, accepting now our supplications, pray thou that we all be saved.

After the blessing of the loaves, we chant the troparion of the holy hierarch, in Tone VIII —

O holy hierarch father John, instructor in piety, feeder of the orphaned, consoler of the sorrowful, physician of the infirm who demandest no fee, speedy helper of those who suffer spiritually, fervent advocate for all before the Lord: Entreat Christ God, that our souls be saved.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O Good One, Who for our sake wast born of the Virgin and, having endured crucifixion, cast down death by death, and as God revealed the resurrection: Disdain not that which Thou hast fashioned with Thine own hand. Show forth Thy love for mankind, O Merciful One. Accept the Theotokos who gave Thee birth and prayeth for us; and save Thy despairing people, O our Savior!

At Matins

On “God is the Lord…”, the troparion of the saint, twice; Glory…, Now & ever…: the resurrectional theotokion in the same tone.

After the first chanting of the Psalter, this sessional hymn, in Tone IV —

When thou wast ill and lay upon thy death-bed, O holy hierarch John, the holy hierarch Theodosius appeared unto thee and commanded: “Serve the liturgy, and thy health shall return!” And giving thy promise without hesitation, thou didst order that everything be prepared for thee to serve in church; and having served the liturgy in full health by the mercy of God, thou didst compose hymns of praise for thy heavenly healer, and didst announce to all the people the miraculous aid of the holy hierarch Theodosius.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O Virgin Theotokos, we acknowledge God Who was incarnate of thee. Entreat Him with the holy hierarch John, that the city of Tobolsk and the whole land of Siberia may be saved.

After the second chanting of the Psalter, this sessional hymn, in Tone II —

At the end of thy life, O holy hierarch John, the Lord, the Chief Shepherd, commanded thee to leave the warm and balmy land of Chernigov and to take up instead the calling of Metropolitan of Tobolsk and all Siberia. And submitting to the will of God, O holy hierarch, thou didst humbly assume the burden of serving in Siberia, showing each of us how to perceive the all-wise hand of the Lord in the ways of our life. Glory to thee, O humble and meek hierarch!

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O pure one, by thy birthgiving thou didst renew the mortal essence of men, which had become subject to corruption through the passions; and thou didst raise up all from death unto the life of incorruption. Wherefore, we all bless thee, as is meet, O all-glorious Virgin, as thou didst foretell.

Polyeleos, and this magnification —

We magnify thee, O holy hierarch John, and we honor thy holy memory; for thou dost entreat Christ God in our behalf.

After the Polyeleos, this sessional hymn, in Tone VIII —

Having acquired pastoral wisdom through humility of mind, O great hierarch, in thy brief sojourn in Siberia thou didst not closely confine to thy heart thy care for the enlightenment of the many peoples of the region of Tobolsk — the Voguls, Ostyaks and Tatars — with the light of Christian doctrine. Wherefore, the Lord, the Bestower of rewards, hath glorified thee in the incorruption of thy relics. Him do thou unceasingly entreat, that He grant remission of transgressions unto those who honor thy holy memory with love.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

Let us hymn the gate of heaven, the most holy mountain, the radiant cloud, the bush which burned without being consumed, the restoration of Eve, the great treasure of the whole world: for in her hath salvation and the remission of the ancient offenses been accomplished for the world. Wherefore, let us cry out to her: Pray thou to thy Son, that He grant remission of transgressions unto those who piously worship thy most holy birthgiving.

Song of Ascents, the first antiphon of Tone IV.

Prokimenon, in Tone IV —

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

*Stichos:* What shall I render unto the Lord for all that He hath rendered unto me?

Let every breath praise the Lord.

Gospel according to John, § 35 \(Jn. 9: 39-10: 9\)

The Lord said to the Jews that came to Him: “For judgment I am come into this world, that those who see not might see; and that those who see might be made blind.” And some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said unto Him: “Are we blind also?” Jesus said unto them: “If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, ‘We see’; therefore your sin remaineth. Verily, verily, I say unto you: He who entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he who entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.” This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again: “Verily, verily, I say unto you: I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before Me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.”

After Psalm 50, this sticheron, in Tone VI —

O venerable father, wonderworker of all Siberia, holy hierarch John! Beseech the Lord to grant us unwavering faith, holy hope and love unfeigned, in that thou thyself, O father, didst glorify our heavenly Father by these virtues. In thy supplications forget not thy children, who venerate thy precious relics and honor thy memory as that of our advocate and one who loveth the poor.

Canon of Supplication \[the Paraclysis\] to the Theotokos, with 6 troparia, including the irmos; and that of the holy hierarch, with 8 troparia, in Tone I —

Ode I

*Irmos:* Let us all chant a hymn of victory unto God, Who hath wrought marvelous wonders with His upraised arm and saved Israel, for He is glorious.

O Word of God, help me worthily to hymn the holy hierarch John, the wonderworker of Siberia, overlooking my transgressions and granting wisdom to my heart and mouth.

O holy hierarch John, thou wast a pious youth, the consolation of thy parents, adept at book-­learning, rendering thine intellect wise with exalted understandings, and cleaving unto the Lord with all thy heart.

Thou didst have a share of deep faith, O venerable one, when, teaching young men, thou didst wisely plant a yearning for the Lord in their hearts, guiding them all to turn to the glory of the Lord.

*Theotokion:* O all-holy Virgin, with John, the holy hierarch of Tobolsk, entreat thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, that He grant us remission of our transgressions and save us from all misfortunes.

Katavasia as prescribed by the Typicon.

Ode III

*Irmos:* The same stone which the builders rejected, is become the head-stone in the ­corner; this is the stone whereon Christ hath established the Church which He redeemed from among the nations.

The Lavra of the Caves of Kiev wholly enthralled thee, O holy hierarch John, and kindled a fire within thy heart; and thou didst forsake the world and all that is in it, and didst serve God in the monastic calling.

Thou didst make thy mind wise with the knowledge of the word of God, O holy hierarch of God, and in the calling of hieromonk didst show forth great talent in preaching the Word of God; and thou didst win the love of the people.

Thou didst move the brethren of the Lavra to compunction, O holy hierarch, when with all thy soul thou gavest thyself over to the intense struggle of prayer and to fervent and constant attendance at the services of the Church throughout thy monastic life; and thou didst render glory unto God Whose pleasure it was to deal with thee thus.

*Theotokion:* O Mother of God, by thine omnipotent entreaties make us emulators of the life of the holy hierarch John, that God, Who resteth in the Holy Trinity, may be glorified in our lives.

Sessional hymn, in Tone VI —

Today the glorious city of Tobolsk is adorned, and all the children of the Church of the land of Siberia rejoice, glorifying the day of the blessed repose of the holy hierarch John; and they are enlightened with zeal for salvation, beholding his relics, which are glorified with incorruption. And they cry aloud unto the Lord: By the supplications of Thy favored one, save Thou our souls!

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O God and Master, look down from heaven, and, through the supplications of Thine all-pure Mother, regard our lowliness and take pity upon us, O All-good One Who lovest mankind; for nowhere else do we hope to receive forgiveness for the evils we have wrought. Wherefore, be Thou with us, and no one will be against us.

Ode IV

*Irmos:* Foreseeing in the Spirit the incarnation of the Word, O Prophet Habbakuk, thou didst announce, crying out: When the years draw nigh, Thou shalt be acknowledged; when the season cometh, Thou shalt be shown forth! Glory to Thy power, O Lord!

Thou didst struggle well in the Holy Lavra, O holy hierarch, and thy solitary prayer made thee a chosen vessel of divine grace. And, recognizing the purity of thy monastic life, the holy hierarch Theodosius of Chernigov summoned thee to that city, and, elevating thee to the rank of archimandrite, entrusted to thy care the governance of the Monastery of Yeletsk.

Thou didst toil for the holy hierarch Theodosius with love and goodly obedience, O holy hierarch John, and after his blessed repose thou wast chosen by the Orthodox people to be his successor in the hierarchal ministry, and wast ordained as Archbishop of Chernigov by the most holy Patriarch Adrian.

Like a radiant lamp set upon the height of thine episcopal cathedra, O holy hierarch, by thy great virtues thou didst win the great love of thy flock. By thy prayers grant also unto us sinners that we may reveal the light of Christ in our lives and be an example for all who seek salvation.

*Theotokion:* O all-pure one, entreat God Who was born of thee without seed, that He set our lives aright, that we may be pleasing unto the Lord in love for our brethren.

Ode V

*Irmos:* Grant us Thy peace, O Son of God, for we know none other than Thee. We call upon Thy name, for Thou art the God of the living and the dead.

With great grief did thy spiritual children of Chernigov accompany thee to the city of Tobolsk; but the monasteries of Tobolsk joyously greeted thee as a herald of peace and teacher of piety. And now all Siberia reverently celebrateth thy memory and prayeth to thee, that thou fence that whole country round about with peace and lead to the kingdom of God those who pray unto thee.

O holy hierarch of Christ, all thy leisure didst thou dedicate to the writing of spiritually profitable books; and thy spiritual children, nurtured on them, have set aside care for what is worldly and striven to obtain everlasting blessedness.

O good and holy hierarch, who can describe thy love for the poor, thy secret visitation of the houses of the destitute, thy conversations with prisoners? Teach us also not to live for ourselves, but to take thought for the poor and to visit the suffering, that we may obtain blessing from the Lord.

*Theotokion:* The holy hierarch John gave to the city of Tobolsk a holy icon of the Mother of God which shineth forth in miracles, that the faithful people might glorify the wondrous aid of the Mother of God and the supplications of its holy hierarch.

Ode VI

*Irmos:* Emulating the Prophet Jonah, I cry out: O Good One, free me from corruption! O Savior of the world, save me who cry out: Glory to Thee!

Thy proclamation of the truths of the Gospel, thy reverent celebration of the divine services, thy meekness and humility, won for thee the tender and holy love of the people. Remember us sinners also at the throne of the King of glory, and grant that we may concern ourselves not with transitory things, but with the acquisition of the good things of the Kingdom of heaven.

The widows and orphans, and all the paupers who resided in Tobolsk, saw thee as their father; and, receiving assistance from thee, they glorified the Lord, the only Teacher of loving-kindness.

By thy works, and thy whole life most of all, thou didst teach all to live according to the Gospel of Christ, O holy hierarch. By thy supplications make us also true fulfillers of the commandments of the Gospel, that with thee we may be accounted worthy to glorify our Savior forever in the mansions of paradise.

*Theotokion:* O our fervent advocate, regard our groans, heal our infirmities, loose thou the burden of our sins, plant love for God and our brethren in our hearts, that, delivered from evils, we may glorify thee, the cause of our salvation.

Kontakion, in Tone II —

Unto those who abide in the darkness of ignorance thou hast appeared as an enlightener, a consoler of widows and orphans, a wondrous physician of the infirm, an instructor of children and youths and the all-radiant joy of parents. O holy hierarch John our father, entreat Christ God, that He grant unto our land confirmation in the Faith, to our army victory and triumph over our enemies, and to thy people great mercy.

*Ikos:* Blessed was thy repose, O holy hierarch! For after the divine liturgy thou didst feed thy friends with whom thou didst labor, as well as the poor; yet thou thyself didst eat naught at table, but, following the example of the Savior, didst act as servant. Thou didst converse meekly with thy spiritual children, and in the evening, having withdrawn to thy cell for prayer, didst pour forth thy soul in prayer before the Lord and the all-pure ­Theotokos, and while prostrate didst surrender thy soul to the Lord. Wherefore, with compunction we all cry out to thee: O great and holy hierarch, beseech the Lord, that He grant also unto all of us who live in the world an end unashamed, strengthening in the Faith, and confirmation in good works, that we may receive great mercy from Christ God.

Ode VII

*Irmos:* The fire neither touched nor vexed Thy children in the furnace, O Savior; for then, as with one mouth, the three hymned and blessed Thee, saying: Blessed is the God of our fathers!

O holy hierarch thou didst love spiritual enlightenment, and in both Chernigov and the city of Tobolsk didst diligently teach future pastors, thyself visiting their school; and thou didst teach the instructor and pupils of the school to cry out to the Lord: Blessed is the God of our fathers!

Who will not praise thy pastoral labors, O intercessor for Siberia? Who will not praise thy care for the heathen people of the region of Tobolsk? Who will not marvel at thy guidance of the pastors of the Church in the preaching of the word of God and in their unceasing exclamation unto the Lord: “Blessed is the God of our fathers!”?

Even during thy lifetime, the suffering and sick received consolation and healing through thee; and after thy blessed repose they have hastened to thy grave, O holy hierarch, and thou hast poured forth gracious help upon them in abundance, that they all may chant in thanksgiving, saying: Blessed is the God of our fathers!

*Theotokion:* Incline thyself unto our entreaties, O pure Theotokos, mercifully approach God in thy supplication, O good one, and render Him merciful unto us who ever trust in thee and cry out: Blessed is the God of our fathers!

Ode VIII

Irmos Christ God, Who saved the chanting children in the furnace and transformed the raging flames into dew, hymn ye and exalt supremely for all ages!

The voice of the people, which is the voice of God, called thee a merciful wonderworker after thy repose, O blessed one; and unto the Lord, Who gave thee the grace of healings, they cried out: Hymn Christ God, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

Thou didst repose amid the heat of summer, O holy hierarch of God, and thy body remained unburied for many days, until the blessed Philotheus returned from his missionary journey. Then, perceiving thy body to be incorrupt, he cried: Hymn Christ God, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

All who suffered in soul and were burdened with sins had recourse to thy tomb, O holy hierarch John, and, receiving gracious help from the Lord through thy prayerful assistance, they cried: Hymn Christ God, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

The faithful bore witness to thy great boldness before God, and, recounting thy mighty intercession, they taught all to cry: Hymn Christ God, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

*Theotokion:* The uttermost abyss of my countless transgressions hath engulfed me, bringing me down into the depths of grievous despair. O thou who gavest birth to the Abyss of loving-kindness, haste thou and save me, that I may cry out from the depths of my heart: Hymn Christ God, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

Ode IX

*Irmos:* The radiant cloud upon which the unoriginate Master of all descended from heaven, like rain upon the fleece, and of whom He was incarnate, becoming man for our sake, let us all magnify as the pure Mother of God.

O holy hierarch John, entreat the Lord and His all-pure Mother, that He grant us all the strength to love the Lord with all our soul and all our heart, and to glorify and hymn His all-pure name. Glory to the Lord Who hath given His hierarch strength! Glory to the Lord Who through the holy hierarch doth graciously help us!

O how great is the power of thy miracles! O how edifying is the splendor of thy life! Having forsaken all earthly things, thou enjoyest ineffable blessedness in heaven. Forget us not in thy holy prayers, O wondrous hierarch!

O great hierarch John of Siberia, Metropolitan of Tobolsk, accept the supplication of us sinners, preserve thy homeland in peace, deprive us not of the good things of this earth, and direct our path to the kingdom of heaven.

*Theotokion:* O all-holy Virgin, during his life the holy hierarch John earnestly poured forth his prayers before thy miraculous image, and now he gazeth upon thy glory in heaven, and hearkeneth to thy supplications for the whole world. With the holy hierarch of Tobolsk, O all-immaculate one, pray thou for the land of Siberia, and direct our path to the kingdom of heaven.

Exapostilarion —

The holy hierarch of Tobolsk and advocate for the whole land of Siberia is glorified by the Church today as a wise governor of the Church, a model of loving-kindness and the adornment of hierarchs.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

The Prophet of old foresaw thee as a lamp of seven lights, bearing the fire of divine knowledge, shining light upon those who languish in the darkness of ignorance. Wherefore, we cry out to thee, O most immaculate one: With the holy hierarch John pray that we be given the light of understanding, the spirit of wisdom and the enlightenment of the eyes of our hearts, that we may see our one God.

On the Praises, 4 stichera, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “O all-glorious wonder” —

O all-glorious wonder! In the city of Tobolsk the holy hierarch John is glorified by the Lord in the incorruption of his relics, the Holy Church entereth his name in the roster of the choir of the saints, the faithful venerate his precious relics with reverence, the sorrowful and sick receive consolation, and all cry out to the holy hierarch in unity of soul: O protector of the land of Siberia, preserve this land and thy city from all want and grief!

O all-glorious wonder! The two holy hierarchs of Siberia — the great Innocent and the divinely wise Sophronius — stand with the new wonderworker and holy hierarch John before the glory of the holy, consubstantial, indivisible and life-creating Trinity. O how great is Thy mercy toward us, O God Who art glorified in Trinity! Accept the supplications of the three holy hierarchs of Siberia, and grant unto their spiritual children confirmation in good works, unto the glory of Thine all-holy name.

O all-glorious wonder! The three holy hierarchs of Siberia brought into the land of Siberia the heritage of the venerable Anthony and Theodosius, and, causing the seed of their evangelism to burgeon forth, they produced fruit an hundredfold. Let us strive, O brethren, to keep the rules of our Siberian instructors. Let these fathers be called our guiding stars; let these Siberian stars point the way to the heavens, that their names may be blessed forever!

O all-glorious wonder! The holy hierarch John, the lover of the poor, surrendered his pure soul into the hands of the Lord before the miraculous icon of the Mother of God; and the Lord hath rewarded him with the gift of miracles and the incorruption of body. In heaven the hierarch is shown to be a tireless advocate for us. Beneath the shelter of his prayer, O ye who love the feasts of the Church, let us not forget the radiant image of our Siberian hierarch, that our journey to the heavens may succeed, that we may glorify our Lord eternally.

Glory…, in Tone VI —

Today the holy hierarch John of Tobolsk is glorified! Today the Holy Church offereth praises to him! Today the faithful children of the Orthodox Church bow down before his much-healing relics! Today all the sorrowful receive gracious consolation, and all the sick cry out for his gracious aid! Today, we sinners cry out with a pure heart: O great and holy hierarch and wonderworker, pray thou to the Lord for the salvation of our souls!

Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O Theotokos, thou art the true vine which hath budded forth for us the Fruit of life. Beseech Him with the holy apostles, we pray thee, O Mistress, that He have mercy upon our souls.

Prokimenon, in Tone I —

My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

*Stichos:* Hear this, all ye nations; give ear, all ye that inhabit the world.

Epistle to the Hebrews, § 335

Brethren: Obey those who have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as ones who must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. Now the God of peace, Who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ; to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Alleluia, in Tone II —

*Stichos:* The mouth of the righteous shall meditate wisdom, and his tongue shall speak of judgment.

*Stichos:* The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be tripped.

Gospel according to John, § 36

The Lord said to the Jews who came to Him: “I am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he who is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down My life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”

Communion Verse —

In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be, he shall not be afraid of evil tidings.
