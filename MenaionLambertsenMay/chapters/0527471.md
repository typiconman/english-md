AT VESPERS

On “Lord, I have cried…”, these stichera of the hieromartyr, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “Thy martyrs, O Lord…”—

The most glorious Therapon, illumined by divine acts, was vouchsafed to behold the beauty of Christ with the eyes of his heart, having pleased Him by his suffering. Wherefore, by grace he ever healeth sufferings of soul and body for those who have recourse unto him with faith.

As a wellspring of living water the all-rich Therapon poureth forth streams of healings and utterly washeth away the defilement of grievous ailments from all who have recourse to him with faith. By his entreaties, O Lord, grant unto all great mercy.

The wondrous Therapon, soaked in the dye of his blood, fashioned a truly most splendid garment of sanctity; and arraying himself magnificently therein, he hath entered the Holy of holies. Through his supplications, O Lord, grant great mercy unto all.

But if Alleluia is to be chanted at Matins instead of “God is the Lord…”, we sing first the following stichera of the Theotokos, in the same tone & melody—

O Mistress, rescue me from the hands of the serpent, the slayer of men, who warreth against me with deception, to slaughter me utterly. Crush his jaws, I pray, and set his machinations at nought, that, delivered from his talons, I may magnify thy power.

O most immaculate one, I am the barren tree which produceth not the fruit of salvation; wherefore, I tremble at the thought of being felled, that, wretch that I am, I shall be cast into the unquenchable fire. Wherefore, I fall down before thee: Deliver me therefrom, and by thy mediation before thy Son show me forth as fruitful.

The deadly dart of desire hath wounded my heart: I have been wounded by ignorance and am incurably ill. O Mother of God, disdain not me, accursed as I am, but grant me healing, in that thou gavest birth to the only merciful Lord and Savior.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion—

My thoughts are impure, my lips deceitful, and all my deeds defiled. What then shall I do? How shall I meet the Judge? O Virgin Mistress, entreat thy Son, Creator and Lord, that He accept my soul in repentance, for He alone is compassionate.

Stavrotheotokion—

“I cannot bear to behold Thee asleep upon the Tree Who gavest vigilance unto all, that Thou mightest give divine and saving vigilance unto all who of old fell into the sleep of perdition through tasting the fruit of disobedience!” the Virgin said, weeping, whom we magnify.

AT MATINS

Canon, the composition of Joseph, in Tone VI—

Ode I

*Irmos:* Traversing the deep on foot, as though it were dry land, and seeing the tyrant Pharaoh drowned, Israel cried aloud: Let us chant unto God a hymn of victory!

Joining chorus with the sacred choirs in the heavens, O Therapon, do thou ever deliver from sufferings and cruel misfortunes those who on earth honor thy holy memory.

Thy sacred and honored suffering which took place in the world moveth the faithful to glorify thee splendidly who wast made bold by grace, O wise Therapon.

The noetic Sun, showing thee forth as a star divinely radiant in the light of thy struggles, illumineth with the radiance of miracles the faithful who praise thee in sacred manner.

*Theotokion:* The sacred choir of the prophets foretold from afar that thou wouldst become the Theotokos, O pure one, who art higher than the cherubim and all creation.

Ode III

*Irmos:* There is none as holy as Thee, O Lord my God, Who hast uplifted the horn of Thy faithful and established us on the rock of the confession of Thee, O Good One.

Thou wast a favorite of Christ, truly bearing thine appropriate name, O martyr, and thou ever healest infirmities of soul and body.

Thy blood, mingled with chrism, rendereth thy priesthood yet more splendid, O holy hierarch and pastor, thou martyr and physician of the sick; wherefore, we praise thee.

Thou dost heal the grievous sufferings of those who approach with faith, cause sicknesses to cease, and wash away the harm caused by evil spirits, by the divine invocation of Christ, O most blessed one.

*Theotokion:* The mind of man is unable to understand the ineffable depths of thy birthgiving, O pure one; for, pouring Himself forth into thy womb in His loving-kindness, God hath restored me wholly.

Sessional hymn, in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: “Thy tomb, O Savior…”—

O favorite of Christ, having suffered lawfully, thou wast shown to be a true hierarch and martyr. Wherefore, we beseech thee: Cure now the persistent sufferings of our souls, O holy one, and entreat Christ, Who willeth mercy and loveth mankind.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion—

To the path of repentance do thou ever guide us who have ever strayed into the trackless wastes of evils and have angered the all-good Lord, O blessed Mary who knewest not wedlock, thou refuge of despairing men and dwelling-place of God.

Stavrotheotokion—

Beholding Thee stretched forth, dead, upon the Cross, O Christ, Thy most immaculate Mother cried out: “O my Son, Who art equally unoriginate with the Father and the Spirit, what is this, Thine ineffable condescension, whereby Thou hast saved the creation of Thine all-pure hands, O Compassionate One?”

Ode IV

*Irmos:* Christ is my power, my God and my Lord, the honored Church doth sing, crying out in godly manner with a pure mind, keeping festival in the Lord.

Having first rid thy soul of the tumult of the passions, O sacred minister, thou didst receive the holy and divine anointing, and at thine end wast adorned with an athlete’s wreath.

Thou art seen ever shining with divine signs and wonders, and dost illumine the whole world, receiving grace from God, O right wondrous holy hierarch.

Thou didst first tend the people with grace and unbloody sacrifices, sacredly hallowed as a holy hierarch; and being slaughtered like a lamb, thou wast brought to the Lord.

*Theotokion:* We bless the Virgin as the portal leading to divine entry, as the divine garden of paradise, as the noetic place of sanctity, as the beauty of Jacob.

Ode V

*Irmos:* With Thy divine light illumine the souls of those who with love rise at dawn unto Thee, O Good One, that they may know Thee, O Word of God, to be the true God Who calleth all forth from the darkness of sin.

Illumined with divine radiance, thou wast shown to be an all-radiant star, enlightening the world with divine signs through the Spirit of God, O holy hierarch Therapon, blessed of God.

As a sacred wholeburnt offering, as a pleasing oblation, as a perfect sacrifice, thou didst offer thyself to the Word Who suffered in the flesh, O holy hierarch father Therapon, becoming a martyr.

Having truly filled the cup of confession most beautifully, O venerable Therapon, thou dost give all to drink of thy mighty suffering, calling them with exalted proclamation.

*Theotokion:* After thine awesome birthgiving thou didst remain a Virgin as thou wast before; for God was born, accomplishing all by His will, O Mary who knewest not wedlock, who art full of the grace of God.

Ode VI

*Irmos:* Beholding the sea of life surging with the tempest of temptations, fleeing to Thy calm haven I cry unto Thee: Lead up my life from corruption, O greatly Merciful One!

Thy manner of living was divine, thy life godly, and thy death glorious, resplendent with the beauties of martyrdom, illumining with the splendors of miracles the hearts of those who hymn thee.

We have recognized thee as a fruitful branch of the true noetic Vine, O divinely wise one, bearing the true grapes of confession which exude the excellent wine of patience.

Thy temple hath been shown to be a place of sacred healing, easing all the pangs of the infirm by grace and releasing them from ailments, O divinely wise and right wondrous hierarch.

*Theotokion:* The Word took on flesh in thy womb without seed and revealed Himself as perfect man, restoring nature in godly manner as He alone knew how, O most immaculate one, thou portal which held God.

There is no kontakion provided for this service.

Ode VII

*Irmos:* The Angel caused the furnace to pour forth dew upon the pious youths, and the command of God, which consumed the Chaldæans, prevailed upon the tyrant to cry out: Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers!

Having subdued the threefold billows of the passions, O venerable one, suffering, thou didst extinguish the conflagration of falsehood with the outpouring of thy blood, O venerable Therapon, hieromartyr of Christ.

Thou wast consecrated by anointing with chrism, O venerable initiate of the mysteries, and, having perfected priests and the people, as a pastor thou didst finish the good race, being slain for Christ, O wise martyr Therapon.

With the torrents of thy blood thou didst drown the hordes of the enemy, and with the radiance of miracles thou dost destroy the gloom of the passions, O Therapon, showing thyself truly to be a wonderworker and physician of the sick.

*Theotokion:* He Who sitteth uncircumscribed in the bosom of the Father, O pure one, now sitteth, circumscribed, in thy womb, encompassed by thy body, to save Adam, becoming a new Adam.

Ode VIII

*Irmos:* From the flame didst Thou pour forth dew upon the venerable ones, and didst consume the sacrifice of the righteous one with water; for Thou, O Christ, dost do all things soever Thou desirest. Thee do we exalt supremely for all ages!

Thou didst offer unbloody sacrifices unto God and wast slaughtered like a pure and innocent lamb; and thou didst abolish demonic sacrifices, O holy hierarch Therapon, thou adornment of athletes.

Having become a resident of paradise, thou wast shown to be a companion of the holy angels, O martyred passion-bearer and minister of Christ, resplendent with the radiance of martyrdom.

Thou didst bring low the prideful serpent with humility of heart, having opposed him manfully, O holy hierarch, staining thy priestly vesture in the blood of martyrdom.

*Theotokion:* Delivered from the primal curse by thy birthgiving, O most blessed and divinely joyous Maiden, we send up to thee the cry of Gabriel: Rejoice, O cause of the salvation of all!

Ode IX

*Irmos:* It is not possible for men to behold God, upon Whom the ranks of angels dare not gaze; but through thee, O most pure one, hath the Word appeared incarnate unto men; and magnifying Him with the armies of heaven, we call thee blessed.

Desiring to behold the glory of the Almighty, thou didst endure an unjust death and didst ascend on thy blood as upon a chariot, O glorious hierarch, and hast soared aloft to the heavens, where, rejoicing, thou hast found rest.

Like light, like the dawn hast thou shone forth upon us, illumining the ends of the earth with radiant beams, O holy hierarch and divinely inspired pastor, and thou freest us from the gloom of the passions. Wherefore, we honor and piously bless thee.

As thou art with the choirs of the patriarchs and martyrs, the apostles, the righteous and the venerable, O divinely blessed one, pray with them, that Christ grant remission of offenses unto all who piously observe thy divine memorial.

The magnificence of thy temple, ever illumined with the effulgence of miracles, freeth from the gloom of the passions those who approach with faith in the Spirit and causeth sicknesses to cease, O martyred hierarch, right wondrous pastor.

*Theotokion:* With thy light illumine me, I pray, O Virgin divinely blessed among women, and deliver me from everlasting fire, that I may magnify and glorify thee, and hymn thy mighty acts as is meet.
