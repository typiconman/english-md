Commemoration of the Seven Holy Enlighteners of the Slavs & the Bulgars, the Equals of the Apostles Methodius & Cyril, Clement & Nahum, Sabbas, Gorazd & Angelarius

At Little Vespers

On “Lord, I have cried…”, 4 stichera, in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: “O most praised martyrs…” —

O ye glorious seven, the Creator adorned you all with the seven gifts of the Spirit, and through you enlightened the Bulgarian people by enabling them to write, and have led them to the Faith. Pray ye now unto Him, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy. *Twice*

O ye glorious seven, to the Bulgars ye trumpeted forth the one God in Trinity, and as the walls of Jericho were once demolished by seven trumpet blasts, so did ye demolish the idols, preaching Christ. Pray ye now unto Him, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

O ye glorious seven, piously celebrating your splendid festival today, we bless you with joy, O Cyril and Methodius, Clement, Nahum and Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius. Wherefore, pray ye unto Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

Glory…, in Tone VI —

O ye seven venerable ones, having mastered the virtues from childhood, ye became instruments of the Holy Spirit; and receiving from Him the skill to fish for men, ye drew the Bulgars forth to piety. Wherefore, as ye have boldness before the Lord, ask ye peace for our souls.

Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O Theotokos, thou art the true vine who budded forth for us the Fruit of life. Unto thee do we pray: With the saints make supplication, O Mistress, that our souls find mercy.

At the Aposticha, these stichera, in Tone II: Spec. Mel.: “O house of Ephratha…” —

Enlightening the Bulgars and Dalmatians in Orthodoxy with the splendor of the virtues, O ye glorious seven, ye led them to the divine Faith.

*Stichos:* Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy righteous shall rejoice.

Having acquired you as teachers and fellow sufferers, helpers and intercessors, and citizens of heaven, we now bless you as is meet.

*Stichos:* Moses and Aaron \[are\] among His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His name.

Let us chant unto God Who hath given us the godly seven, the preachers of the Faith, as healing for our souls and bodies.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O pure Mistress, Mother of Emmanuel, with the holy apostles pray that the Christian race be saved.

Troparion, in Tone I —

With wreaths of praise let us crown the glorious seven — Cyril and Methodius, Clement, Nahum and Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius — as beacons who shone forth and proclaimed to us the glad tidings of the triune God, unshakable pillars of the Church of Bulgaria, and divinely inspired champions of the literature thereof, who abolished the demonic worship of idols, and who pray unto Christ God, that He make steadfast our Church and grant our souls peace and great mercy.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

When Gabriel announced to thee, Rejoice! O Virgin, the Master of all became incarnate within thee, the holy tabernacle, at His cry, as the righteous David said. Thou wast shown to be more spacious than the heavens, having borne thy Creator. Glory to Him Who made His abode within thee! Glory to Him Who came forth from thee! Glory to Him Who hath set us free by thy birthgiving!

At Great Vespers

After the Introductory Psalm, we chant “Blessed is the man…”, the first antiphon.

On “Lord, I have cried…”, 6 stichera, in Tone II: Spec. Mel.: “With what wreaths of praise…” —

With what wreaths of praise shall we crown the glorious seven, who though separate in body were united in spirit: the God-bearing champions of the Trinity, who suffered for their preaching of the Gospel, the beacons who enlightened Dalmatia, the pillars which made Bulgaria steadfast, whom Christ our God, Who hath great mercy, crowneth as victors with wreaths of glory? *Twice*

With what flowers of hymnody shall we crown the glorious seven, who were equally honored with grace and apostolic gifts: the beautiful receptacles of the Spirit, the pastors Christ-like in faith, the teachers of the sublime dogmas of the Church, who became earthly angels through heavenly glory, whom Christ our God hath honored, Who hath great mercy? *Twice*

With what beauties of hymnody shall we praise the glorious seven: Cyril and Methodius, Clement, Nahum and Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius, who proclaimed the one God to us in three Persons and confirmed the Orthodox Faith? For Christ our God, Who hath great mercy, doth truly crown them with wreaths of immortal glory as is meet. *Twice*

Glory…, in Tone VI —

Let us praise today the mystic clarions of the Spirit, the seven radiant and God-bearing fathers, who with apostolic wisdom clearly proclaimed the glory of God and have shown us the way into heaven, who restored the multitudes of Bulgaria by enabling them to write, and utterly consumed the worship of idols with the fire of the Spirit. Wherefore, let us cry aloud unto them, saying: O divine fathers, equals of the apostles, pray ye to the Lord, that He establish our race in Orthodoxy and save our souls.

Now & ever…: Dogmatic theotokion, in the same tone —

Who doth not call thee blessed, O all-holy Virgin? Who will not hymn thine all-pure birth­giving? For the only-begotten Son Who shone forth timelessly from the Father, came forth, ineffably incarnate, from thee, the pure one; and being God by nature, He became man for our sake, not divided into two Persons, but known in two natures without confusion. Him do thou beseech, O pure and most blessed one, that our souls find mercy!

Entrance. Prokimenon of the day. Three readings:

A Reading from Proverbs

The memory of the just is praised, and the blessing of the Lord is upon his head. Blessed is the man who hath found wisdom, and the mortal who knoweth prudence. For it is better to traffic for her, than for treasures of gold and silver. And she is more valuable than precious stones: no precious thing is equal to her in value. For length of existence and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and glory: out of her mouth righteousness proceedeth, and she carrieth law and mercy upon her tongue. Hearken to me, O children, for I will speak solemn truths. Blessed is the man who shall keep my ways; for my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and in them is prepared favor from the Lord. Ye, O men, do I exhort; and utter my voice to the sons of men. I, wisdom, have built up; upon counsel, knowledge and understanding have I called. Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and strength is mine. I love those that love me; they that seek me shall find grace. O ye simple, understand subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge. Hearken unto me again; for I will speak solemn truths. For my throat shall meditate truth; and false lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or perverse. They are all evident to those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge. For I will instruct you in truth, that your hope may be in the Lord, and ye may be filled with the Spirit.

A Reading from Proverbs

The mouth of the righteous droppeth wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall perish. The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse. False balances are an abomination before the Lord: but a just weight is acceptable unto Him. Wherever pride entereth, there will also disgrace: but the mouth of the humble doth meditate wisdom. The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the overthrow of the rebellious shall spoil them. Possessions shall not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness will deliver from death. When a just man dieth, he leaveth regret: but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and causeth joy. Righteousness traceth out blameless paths: but ungodliness encountereth unjust dealing. The righteousness of upright men delivereth them: but transgressors are caught in their own destruction. At the death of a just man his hope doth not perish: but the boast of the ungodly perisheth. A righteous man escapeth from a snare, and the ungodly man is delivered up in his place. In the mouth of ungodly men is a snare for citizens: but the understanding of righteous men is prosperous. In the prosperity of righteous men a city prospereth, but at the destruction of the wicked there is exultation. At the blessing of the upright a city shall be exalted, but by the mouths of ungodly men it is overthrown. A man void of understanding sneereth at his fellow citizens: but a sensible man is quiet.

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

Though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. For honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him; so that, living among sinners, he was translated. Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of lust doth undermine the simple mind. He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time; for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted He to take him away from among the wicked. This the people saw, and understood not, neither laid they up this in their minds: that His grace and mercy is with His saints, and that He doth visit His chosen.

At Litia, the sticheron of the temple, and these stichera of the saints —

*In Tone I:* Come, ye assemblies of those who love the feasts of the Church, and let us offer the praise of hymnody today to the seven blessed equals of the apostles, who having lifted up their eyes with exalted understanding and penetrated the unknown depths of the wisdom of God, enriched the hard-hearted Bulgarian race with divinely wise teachings, and pray for our souls.

*In Tone II:* Having lawfully trained your souls and bodies with divine activities, ye thundered forth Orthodox dogmas; and, mingling with the angelic hosts, ye unceasingly chant a hymn of victory unto God in three Hypostases. To Him do we also cry out: O God Who art known in Trinity, through the supplications of Thy seven saints have mercy and save us!

*In Tone III:* O glorious seven, great glory of the Church of Christ, who manfully fought the good fight and finished the course of your preachings, ye have attained unto the mansions of heaven. Rejoicing with the angels, pray ye ever for us, that our souls may find deliverance.

Glory…, in Tone IV —

O ye seven glorious ones, your good works shone forth like the sun, on earth and in heaven; for, preaching the unoriginate begetting of the Son and the procession of the Spirit from the one Father, ye put the heretics to shame and drew savage pagans to the true Faith of Christ. Wherefore, pray ye to the Lord, that He grant us great mercy.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone —

Mercifully regard the supplications of thy servants, O all-immaculate one, quelling the uprisings of the cruel demons against us, delivering us from every sorrow; for thee alone have we as a steadfast and sure confirmation, and we have acquired thine intercession; let not us that call upon thee be put to shame, O Mistress. Haste thou to answer the entreaty of those who cry out to thee with faith: Rejoice, thou help, joy and protection of all, and salvation of our souls!

On the aposticha, these stichera, in Tone V: Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice…” —

Rejoice, O seven-member choir, mighty bulwark of Bulgaria, pillars and foundation of Dalmatia, ye champions of the Trinity! O ye who tended the people of Christ on the pastures of divine dogmas and drove the wolves of heresy far from them, ye minds most splendid in form and wisdom, who now dwell, rejoicing, with the archangels: Entreat ye Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

*Stichos:* Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy righteous shall rejoice.

Rejoice, O seven-member choir, stars of the earthly firmament and lights of the effulgence of the threefold Sun, rays of inexhaustible love, instruments of the Holy Spirit, lucid preachers of grace, right eloquent teachers of the Scriptures, stentorian heralds of the law, worthy inhabitants of paradise, and guides for those below to that which is on high! Entreat ye Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

*Stichos:* Moses and Aaron \[are\] among His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His name.

Rejoice, O seven-member choir, Methodius and Cyril, Clement and Nahum, Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius, ye earthly angels who traverse the heavens, boast of the Bulgars and joy of the Dalmatians, most skillful physicians, ever-flowing rivers of the Spirit, who watered the earth with your preaching, breasts inexhaustibly pouring forth the milk of salvation, beauty of most precious wisdom! Entreat ye Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

Glory…, in Tone VIII —

Ascending on a chariot traversing the heavens, O ye glorious seven, ye attained the summit of the virtues through abstinence; and as vessels of the Holy Spirit, ye drew hard-hearted pagans to the immaculate Faith of Christ by the demonstration of miracles. Having received the reward of your painful struggles as is meet, ye have become heirs to Eden and rejoice with the captains of the ranks of heaven. Pray ye to the Savior, the God of all, that He bring peace to the world and save our souls.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone —

O unwedded Virgin who ineffably conceived God in the flesh, Mother of God Most High: Accept the entreaties of thy servants, O most immaculate one, granting unto all cleansing of transgressions; and, accepting now our supplications, pray thou that we all be saved.

After the blessing of the loaves, the troparion of the saints, in Tone I —

With wreaths of praise let us crown the glorious seven — Cyril and Methodius, Clement, Nahum and Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius — as beacons who shone forth and proclaimed to us the glad tidings of the triune God, unshakable pillars of the Church of Bulgaria, and divinely inspired champions of the literature thereof, who abolished the demonic worship of idols, and who pray unto Christ God, that He make steadfast our Church and grant our souls peace and great mercy. *Twice*

And “Virgin Theotokos, rejoice…”, once.

O all ye faithful, let us honor today the clarions of Christ, the seven glorious ones, who have proclaimed to us God the Trinity, the begetting \[of the Son\] and the procession \[of the Spirit\] from the Father, and who by the grace of the Spirit have drawn us out of the abyss of unbelief to the Orthodox Faith.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion —

O Christ our God, act Thou quickly before we are enslaved by the enemy who blasphemeth Thee and oppresseth us. By Thy Cross destroy those who wage war against us, that they may understand what power the Orthodox Faith doth have, through the supplications of the Theotokos, O Thou Who alone lovest mankind.

Gospel according to Luke, § 51

\(Lk. 10: 16-21\)

The Lord said to His disciples: “He that heareth you heareth Me; and he that despiseth you despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me despiseth Him Who sent Me.” And the seventy returned again with joy, saying: “Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through Thy name.” And He said unto them: “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.” In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said: “I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.”

After Psalm 50, this sticheron, in Tone VI —

Grace was poured forth in your lips, O venerable fathers, and ye became shepherds of the Church of Christ, teaching the reason-endowed sheep to believe in the consubstantial Trinity in a single Godhead.

Canon of Supplication to the Theotokos \[the Paraclysis\], with 6 troparia, including the irmos; and that of the saints, the acrostic whereof is “I, Gregory, hymn the seven”, in Tone IV —

Ode I

*Irmos:* I will open my mouth, and with the Spirit will it be filled; and I shall utter discourse unto the Queen and Mother, and shall appear, keeping splendid festival; and, rejoicing, I will hymn her wonders.

O ye seven all-radiant and divine luminaries of the noetic firmament, enlighten my darkened mind with the light of the knowledge of God, that, rejoicing, I may sing hymns to you.

Desiring to follow in the footsteps of Thee, O Christ Who endured the Cross and death for our sake, out of love for Thee the seven mortified the flesh with its passions and lusts.

Christ making His abode within you, O ye blessed seven, the Father Who is enthroned in the highest sent dew down upon you from above — the rain of the seven gifts of the good pleasure of the Comforter, as Isaiah said of old.

*Theotokion:* O all-pure one, thou didst conceive Him Who was begotten without mother before time began, and gavest birth to Him without father, without change or confusion; and thou hast stood forth, splendidly adorned, as the immaculate Bride of the Almighty.

Ode III

*Irmos:* O Theotokos, thou living and abundant fountain: in thy divine glory establish those who hymn thee and spiritually form themselves into a choir; and vouchsafe unto them crowns of glory.

The fiery might of the trilingual heresy was extinguished, for the holy seven plunged the whole land of Bulgaria into the font of baptism.

Honoring the hierarchy of the Church, the seven journeyed to Rome, confirmed the Slavonic books, and brought the Bulgarian race to the Orthodox Faith through the preaching of the law of God.

O Christ, we truly praise the equals of Thine apostles — Methodius and Cyril, Clement and Nahum, Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius — who dwell with the angels.

*Theotokion:* O Theotokos, thou gavest birth unto the Mediator of immortality Who in holiness resteth in the saints, for thou hast been seen to be the uncultivated field which produced the Grain of life for all to share.

Ode IV

*Irmos:* Seated in glory upon the throne of the Godhead, Jesus most divine hath come on a light cloud, and with His incorrupt arm hath saved those who cry: Glory to Thy power, O Christ!

Following the sayings of the prophets and in the footsteps of the apostles, O divinely wise ones, ye preached to the Slavic peoples God in Trinity: the Father of the perfect Son, Who sendeth forth the Spirit.

Desiring to behold the glory of God in accordance with the Gospel, ye preserved the purity of your hearts and, strengthened by the Spirit, ye manfully endured many tribulations, persecutions, wounds and wicked oppression for the Christian Faith.

*Theotokion:* Come, all ye faithful, and with hymns let us render goodly praise to the all-pure Mary, who unceasingly intercedeth for us before God, for she is incomparably more exalted than the seraphim and is a reliable Mediatress for men.

Ode V

*Irmos:* All things are filled with awe at thy divine glory; for thou, O Virgin who hast not known wedlock, didst contain within thy womb Him Who is God over all, and gavest birth to the timeless Son, granting peace unto all who hymn thee.

Your loud proclamation hath gone forth into all the earth, O ye seven, and your divinely wise preaching to the ends of the north: and thereby have those who believed on the uncreated Trinity been saved.

The same Lord Who promised to make of Abraham a blessing for the nations gave you to the Bulgarian race as a blessing; wherefore, ye have received your reward and have entered into the joy of your Lord.

Sent unto the Bulgars, ye proclaimed to them the uncreated Trinity of the Godhead — the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; and ye have set all heresies utterly at nought and driven them far away like wolves.

Let the abundant grace of the holy seven drop down miracles today from on high, that all the assemblies of the world, who hymn them with songs of love, may be filled to repletion.

As equals of the apostles, ye considered all transitory things to be as dung, O seven-member choir; and ye loved divine and incorrupt things. And glorifying the eternal Christ, ye have received everlasting glory.

Manifestly acknowledging the sweat ye shed for the Faith, O divinely wise ones, the Lord hath now given to you, the glorious ones, a habitation among the firstborn.

*Theotokion:* O most immaculate Theotokos, the Word of God, Who looked down upon thee from on high at His own nativity, hath saved the human race from the sin of demonic idolatry.

Kontakion, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Having been lifted up…” —

Having shown yourselves to be invincible in asceticism, with divine power ye vanquished the invisible foe; and having instructed the unenlightened Bulgars in the Orthodox Faith, ye received crowns. Pray unto Christ in our behalf, O ye seven, that He grant us remission of transgressions.

*Ikos:* Come, O ye faithful, and let us render goodly praise unto the seven God-bearers, the preachers of piety who shone forth in asceticism, the true pillars and foundation of the Church, the clarions of the divine dogmas of Christ, who burned up heresies with the fire of the Spirit and openly proclaimed the Orthodox Faith; for, having grafted the Bulgarian race from the wild olive-tree onto that which is good by enabling them to write, they led all to the immaculate Faith through divine baptism. Wherefore, let us cry out to them: O ye seven most godly equals of the apostles, pray unto Christ in our behalf, that He grant us remission of transgressions.

Ode VII

*Irmos:* The divinely wise youths worshipped not a creation rather than the Creator, but, manfully trampling the threat of the fire underfoot, they rejoice, chanting: Blessed art Thou, the all-hymned God of our fathers!

Having paternally recounted the mysteries of the Spirit in the Slavic tongue and been imprisoned therefor, when they were released from bonds the seven chanted in joy: O all-hymned Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

By your teaching of the understanding of the Most High ye were shown to be healers of men on earth; and now, the reflection having been abolished, ye chant unceasingly to the King of all: O all-hymned Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

O Light of the threefold Sun, uncreated from the beginning, O all-divine Trinity — Father, Son and divine Spirit: Take pity on us through the entreaties of Thy seven saints, who chant: O all-hymned Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

*Theotokion:* O most immaculate Bride, thou hast been shown to be the animate habitation, the beautiful palace and golden throne of the Creator, to Whom we cry: O all-hymned Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

Ode VIII

*Irmos:* The birthgiving of the Theotokos saved the pious children in the furnace — then in figure, but now in deed — and it moveth all the world to chant to Thee: Hymn ye the Lord and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

Delivering us from all affliction and everlasting torment through the supplications of the seven, have compassion upon us, O unoriginate Trinity, and vouchsafe Eden unto us who chant: Hymn the Lord, O ye works, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

The uncreated light of the Unoriginate One illumined you with divine rays, preserved your apostolic ways, and hath moved the whole world to chant with you: Hymn the Lord, O ye works, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

*Theotokion:* Through thee hath salvation now truly come closer to men, O pure one; wherefore, deliver from offenses me who flee beneath thy protection and fervently chant: Hymn the Lord, O ye works, and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

Ode IX

*Irmos:* Let every mortal leap for joy, enlightened by the Spirit; and let the nature of the incorporeal intelligences keep festival, honoring the sacred feast of the Mother of God, and let them cry aloud: Rejoice, O most blessed Theotokos, pure Ever-virgin!

As receptacles of the Spirit, preachers of the Word and reflections of the Father, O glorious seven, with divine joy ye now rejoice with the angels, standing before the throne of the Most High.

O ye seven fathers, Methodius and Cyril, Clement and Nahum, Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius, pray unceasingly for us to the Lord, that He grant us forgiveness for our many sins and the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom.

*Theotokion:* O Mother of God, thou unblemished heifer, free us from the bonds of the passions, quell the turmoil of our sins, dispel the temptations of the evil one, and make the generations of the ungodly subject to the pious through thy supplications.

Exapostilarion: Spec. Mel.: “Hearken, ye women…” —

Let us all earnestly praise today the seven preachers of the Faith, the godly equals of the apostles, Methodius and Cyril, Clement and Nahum, Sabbas, Gorazd and Angelarius, the pastors of Bulgaria and beacons of Dalmatia.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same melody —

O most honored Mary, thou golden censer, who wast the receptacle of the infinite Godhead: in thee the Father was well pleased, the Son made His abode, and the Holy Spirit, overshadowing thee, showed thee to be the Theotokos, O Maiden.

On the Praises, 4 stichera, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “O all-glorious wonder…” —

O all-glorious wonder! Pouring forth the waters of the Holy Spirit, God filled His seven saints with His wisdom and sent them to the Bulgars as priests and preachers of the Word. O Thine ineffable providence, O Master! Thereby save Thou our souls, O Christ, in that Thou alone art full of loving-kindness. *Twice*

O all-glorious wonder! On his seven saints, as upon seven pillars, did God establish the Church of the fierce Bulgars through the preaching of the Scriptures and the devising of Slavonic letters. O Thy great judgments, O Master! Thereby save Thou our souls, O Christ, in that Thou alone art full of loving-kindness.

O all-glorious wonder! In bestowing upon the seven the glorious ability to work miracles, God hath delivered the demonized from torments, the suffering from cruel infirmities, and all from the defilement of sins. O Thy great wonders, O Master! Thereby save Thou our souls, O Christ, in that Thou alone art full of loving-kindness.

Glory…, in Tone IV —

O ye venerable seven, having received the teaching office of the apostles and become receptacles of the Holy Spirit by your virtuous life, ye explained clearly the dogmas of the Orthodox Church and firmly established the pious Faith among the Bulgars. And standing now before the exalted throne of the Holy Trinity in the heavens with the immaterial choirs, pray ye to our Savior and Lord, that He grant peace to the world and save our souls.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone —

Preserve thy servants from all misfortunes, O blessed Theotokos, that we may glorify thee, the hope of our souls.

Prokimenon, in Tone I —

My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

*Stichos:* Hear this, all ye nations; give ear, all ye that inhabit the world.

Epistle to the Hebrews, §318 \[7: 26-8: 2\]

Brethren: Such a high priest became us, Who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people: for this He did once, when He offered up Himself. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a High Priest, Who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a Minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

Alleluia, in Tone II —

*Stichos:* The mouth of the righteous shall meditate wisdom, and his tongue shall speak of judgment.

*Stichos:* The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be tripped.

Gospel according to John, § 36 \(Jn. 10: 9-16\)

The Lord said to the Jews who came to Him: “I am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down My life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold, and one Shepherd.”
