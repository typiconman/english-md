Now & ever…: The dogmatic theotokion for little vespers, of the tone of the week.

At the Aposticha, these stichera, in Tone V—

Rejoice, O beauteous choir of unmercenary physicians, ye blessed ones who, as divinely wise, loved God with all your heart and soul, mind and strength, and also loved your neighbor as yourselves with all your soul, which ye showed by your deeds! Moving from place to place, and suffering exceedingly, ye gave healing to all without fee. Entreat Christ, that He grant us great mercy.

*Stichos:* Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.

Rejoice, O glorious assembly of unmercenary physicians, ye who, most wise, showed yourselves to be abodes of the all-divine Trinity by the purity of your souls and bodies, who have been shown to be lustrous mirrors, and by the Trinity are now filled with clear effulgence! Ye have become as all-radiant as the sun, for with rays of miracles ye illumine the whole world, dispelling the darkness of the passions. Wherefore, we entreat you: Beseech Christ, that He grant us great mercy.

*Stichos:* What is so good or so joyous as for brethren to dwell together in unity?

Rejoice, O glorious assembly of unmercenary physicians, who after death watch over all the world even as ye did while alive, O most blessed ones who burn with love and sympathy for all, universal saviors and most fervent helpers for those who have recourse to your temple, salubrious wellsprings from whence we draw forth cures! With love do we honor you who pray to Christ, that He send down great mercy upon us.

Glory…, in Tone II—

O divinely wise Panteleimon, athlete of Christ God, thou takest pity upon all who with faith call upon thee, the ready intercessor in need, the deliverer amid misfortunes and tribulations, the unmercenary healer amid sickness, who hast a name truly in accordance with thy merciful ways. Wherefore, deliver us who have recourse unto thee from all infirmity and grievous sickness, praying for the salvation of our souls.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone—

O new wonder greater than all the wonders of the past! For who hath ever known a mother to give birth without having known a man, and to bear on her arm Him Who sustaineth all creation? Yet it was the will of God to be born. O all-pure one, who bore Him in thine arms as an infant and hast maternal boldness before Him: cease not to pray in behalf of those who honor thee, that He have compassion and save our souls.

Troparion of the unmercenaries, in Tone VIII—

O holy unmercenary physicians and wonderworkers, visit our infirmities. Freely have ye received; freely give unto us.

On “Lord, I have cried…”, 4 stichera for the resurrection; and 6 stichera of the unmercenaries, in Tone IV—

Come, ye faithful, and with hymns let us honor all the holy unmercenary physicians, crying out to them with love: Rejoice, O unmercenary physicians of the infirm! Rejoice, ye who have acquired the inexhaustible grace of healings! Rejoice, O ye who pray fervently for the salvation of our souls!

Together let us now hymn all the valiant unmercenaries, who bear a common title, our divine guardians, who with the zeal of faith and love for God gave themselves over steadfastly to the common good of all, for whom they suffered much for Christ, and who pray with boldness for the salvation of our souls.

Let us glorify the honored boast of the Church, the glorious unmercenaries, the invincible champions, the faithful helpers of those who with faith flee to them amid all tribulations, the ever-flowing rivers which pour forth streams of healings, anticipating in all things the needs of all, and praying for the salvation of our souls.

As ye have the boldness before our most merciful Savior to have mercy on all and save them from misfortunes, deliver from sufferings and disease, and from all grievous temptations, those who hymn you with faith and love, O all ye divinely blessed unmercenaries, and pray ye also for the salvation of our souls.

Having kept well the commandments of the Lord, and utterly cut off from yourselves the sickness of avarice, ye freely heal infirmities, O all-glorious Cosmas and Damian. Wherefore, we bless you as is meet, O most honored wonderworkers, who pray for the salvation of our souls.

O unmercenary healer Panteleimon, the most merciful God, seeing thee rich in mercy and compassion, gave thee rich grace to heal all the infirm. Wherefore, treat thou the diseases of the souls and bodies of those who call upon thee with faith, and pray for the salvation of our souls.

Now & ever…: Dogmatic theotokion, in the tone of the week.

Entrance. Prokimenon. Three Readings:

Reading From The Book Of The Prophet Isaiah

Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He: before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside Me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God. Yea, before the day was I am He; and there is none that can deliver out of My hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Thus saith the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with Him: for grace and mercy is to His saints, and He hath care for His elect.

Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

Though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. For honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age. He pleased God, and was loved of Him: so that living among sinners he was translated. Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind. He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time: for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted He to take him away from among the wicked. This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, that His grace and mercy is with His saints, and that He hath respect unto His chosen.

At the Litia, the sticheron of the temple, and these stichera of the unmercenaries—

*In Tone I:* In gladness of spirit, O brethren, let us celebrate today, as is meet, the holy and radiant memorial of all the most honorable unmercenary physicians, for they are our common intercessors, helpers and saviors, and they deliver from sickness and tribulations those who have recourse unto them with faith.

*In Tone II:* O holy unmercenary physicians, the human mind is unable to comprehend the inexhaustible wealth of your compassion and goodness, and even the most eloquent of tongues cannot describe the multitude of your miracles. Wherefore, we cry to you with gladness: Rejoice, O ever-flowing rivers of gifts!

*In Tone IV:* Having received from Christ God on high the gift of miracles, ye heal all sufferings without exacting any fee: for the grace of the Spirit was revealed within you, which imparteth the power of healings. Wherefore, deliver us who hymn you from grievous sickness and all oppression, we beseech you, O divinely wise unmercenary physicians.

Glory…, in Tone VIII—

Who doth not marvel, who doth not glorify, who doth not hymn with faith the miracles of the wise and all-glorious unmercenary physicians? For even after their holy repose they grant cures in abundance unto all who have recourse unto them, and their precious and holy relics pour forth the grace of healings. O the honored ones! O the wisdom and glory of the grace imparted to them by God! Wherefore, in hymns we cry out to God our Benefactor, Who hath shown them to be the healing of our souls and bodies.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone—

O unwedded Virgin who ineffably conceived God in the flesh, Mother of God Most High: Accept the entreaties of thy servants, O most immaculate one, granting unto all cleansing of transgressions; and, accepting now our supplications, pray thou that we all be saved.

On the Aposticha, the stichera of the resurrection, in the tone of the week.

Glory…, in Tone VI—

Today the radiant and luminous memorial of all the unmercenaries of Christ hath shone forth, brilliantly enlightening the whole world with rays of miracles. Come, therefore, and let us celebrate with faith! Come, let us all hasten with fervor to the relics of the saints, that from them we may receive speedy healing in abundance! For without fee they impart gifts of healing through the activity of the Holy Spirit unto all.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone—

Christ the Lord, my Creator and Deliverer, Who came forth from thy womb, O all-pure one, and robed Himself in me, hath freed Adam from the curse. Wherefore, like the angel do we unceasingly cry out to thee, O most pure one, who art truly the Mother of God and Virgin: Rejoice! Rejoice, O Mistress, thou intercession, protection and salvation for our souls!

After the Blessing of the Loaves, “Virgin Theotokos, rejoice!…”, twice, and the troparion of the unmercenaries, in Tone VIII—

While joining chorus in the habitations on high, ye do not forsake those below, O divinely blessed unmercenary physicians; for ye visit with mercy those who call upon you, delivering them from a great multitude of evils, in that ye are the guardians of our life.

O ye saints, how can we fittingly praise your love for God and neighbor, whereby ye do good to all who stand in need of your help? Wherefore, cease ye never to help us who ask your aid.

Ode I

*Irmos:* I will open my mouth, and with the Spirit will it be filled; and I shall utter discourse unto the Queen and Mother, and shall appear, keeping splendid festival; and, rejoicing, I will hymn her wonders.

O radiant servants of the Lord, pray for me who with faith beg to be granted the discourse of wisdom, that, rejoicing, I may hymn your honored festival.

Honoring the memory of the unmercenary physicians today, with a pure heart and unsullied conscience let us hymn them, that through their intercession we may receive the grace of healing.

The earth gave rise to you, O divine unmercenaries, and heaven holdeth your souls, O glorious ones; for, having lived a heavenly life on earth, ye now rejoice on high together.

Having mastered the skill of treating men’s souls more than their bodies, O Luke, thou wast shown to be in all ways most good and inspired by the wisdom of God, wherewith thou treatest those who call upon thee.

The church wherein thy long-suffering body lieth is healing for the sick, O hieromartyr Antipas, and it emitteth the divine radiance of the Spirit.

Ode III

*Irmos:* O Theotokos, thou living and abundant fountain: in thy divine glory establish those who hymn thee and spiritually form themselves into a choir; and vouchsafe unto them crowns of glory.

Like luminaries in the divine firmament of the Church, ye illumine the faithful with the light of miracles, which do ye never cease to perform, O glorious ones, healing men’s infirmities.

Having finished the same race, ye were vouchsafed the same gifts, and have received equal honors in heaven, O wonder-working unmercenaries.

Bound to God and neighbor by love, by grace ye destroy all the malice of the demons; wherefore, we celebrate your festival, O right wondrous ones.

In that the divine fire burneth within you, O blessed of God, extinguish the flame of our passions, warming our minds with faith.

We now hymn the three most honored pairs of unmercenaries Cosmas and Damian, whose works were the same, as were their names.

Radiant of life, steadfast of faith and equal in zeal, they shone forth from Rome, Asia and Arabia. Wherefore, let them be honored together by us.

*Ikos:* The discourse of the wise physicians passeth all understanding and wisdom, and they give knowledge unto all; for, having received the grace of the Most High, they invisibly grant healing unto all. Wherefore, it hath been given to me to recount and hymn their grace, in that they are God-bearing favorites and servants of Christ, who bestow a multitude of miracles; for they deliver all from sickness, healing the world by their miracles.

Sessional hymns of the unmercenary physicians, in Tone VIII—

*Now & ever…:* Come, let us magnify the Queen of all with our voices, and chanting, let us cry aloud: O most hymned Virgin, cause of joy, save those who honor thee, and protect us from all manner of temptations, ailments and tribulations; for as the Mother of God thou hast the boldness to pray for us. Wherefore, we beseech thee: Entreat thy Son and God, that He grant forgiveness to thy servants.

Ode IV

*Irmos:* Perceiving the inscrutable counsel of God, *—* the Incarnation of Thee, the Most High, from the Virgin *—* the Prophet Habbakuk cried aloud: Glory to Thy power, O Lord!

Lo! the glorious and most radiant memorial of the divinely brilliant physicians hath shone forth, gladdening the hearts of the Christian people who have recourse to their healing relics.

Exceeding good is it to remember today the all-praised greatmartyr Panteleimon and his glorious instructor Hermolaus, as among the foremost unmercenaries.

With mouth and heart let us all hymn Hermolaus and Panteleimon, the athletes of Christ, crying: Rejoice, O our healers, ye intercessors and helpers of this community!

Through the sacred entreaties of Hermolaus and Panteleimon, the namesake of mercy, take not Thy mercy away from us, O most merciful Lord, and, having pity as is Thy wont, deliver us from evils.

O Panteleimon, thou wast shown to be splendid in thy manner of life and yet more splendid in thy struggles, enriched with knowledge from on high, which thy works proclaim; and thou takest pity upon all who call upon thee for help.

Thou takest away every ailment from those who flee to thy protection, O healer. And now, visit those who pray to thee with faith, and deliver them from multifarious infirmities.

*Glory…:* O Panteleimon, thou adornment of the honored unmercenaries, ornament of the holy martyrs and physician of the infirm: Be thou a mediator for us before the all-holy Trinity.

*Now & ever…:* Thy grace and the surpassing wealth of Thy love for mankind fill thy most good Mother and the all-honored unmercenaries to overflowing, as they were a cup.

*Irmos:* All things are filled with awe at thy divine glory; for thou, O Virgin who hast not known wedlock, didst contain within thy womb Him Who is God over all, and gavest birth to the timeless Son, granting peace unto all who hymn thee.

Let us hymn the divine love of Cyrus and John and the martyric death they suffered for Christ; for having manfully contended through their glorious struggle, they have been shown to be the boast of the martyrs.

Two luminaries, Cyrus and John, shine forth the effulgence of miracles from a single radiant source, pouring forth the grace of incorruption upon the infirm. Let us therefore call them blessed.

O Cyrus and John who art most rich, ye warriors of Christ and physicians of the infirm: having received from the most compassionate God the ability to work miracles, heal those who hymn you.

With hymns do I praise Mocius, Photius and Anicetas, who are in the choir of the God-bearing unmercenaries, the speedy helpers of those who call upon them amid misfortunes and tribulations.

Possessing thee as a lustrous pearl, precious in thy wounding, O most blessed Mocius, physician who exactest no fee, the honored Church is adorned.

Ye were shown to be great beacons illumining all creation with rays of healing and divine struggles, O Photius and Anicetas, ye athletes of Christ.

*Glory…:* Ye heal the passions of the faithful, portraying the blessed Passion in your sufferings; and ye banish ailments and drive away evil spirits, O glorious Photius and Anicetas.

*Now & ever…:* O almighty Mistress, transform the weakness and impotence of our souls and bodies into strength and health, that we may vigilantly carry out the commandments of thy Son and God.

Ode VI

*Irmos:* Celebrating this divine and most honored festival of the Mother of God, come, ye divinely wise, let us clap our hands and glorify God Who was born of her.

Celebrating your most honored festival, O all-praised emulators of Christ and most fervent mediators, with faith we ask help of you.

Submitting to the divine command, O divinely wise ones, ye desired to take nothing in fee. Freely did ye receive: freely give those things which conduce to life and salvation.

Today let us all honor with honorable praises the venerable Sampson and Diomedes of the choir of the unmercenaries, setting them forth as advocates before God, the King of all.

With thine all-glorious physicianship, which thou didst acquire through pangs, O father, cease not to visit us, we pray, easing the ailments and labors of our souls with thy compassion.

Invested with divine power, O martyr Diomedes, thou dost cause illnesses to cease, dost banish infirmities and drivest evil spirits away, in that thou art most excellent among unmercenary physicians.

The grace of the Spirit adorned thee with rich gifts; for by thy supplications, O glorious Artemius, every sickness ceaseth among those who have recourse unto thee.

*Glory…:* O greatmartyr Artemius, emulator of the Savior and favorite of the Trinity, from corruption, passions, temptations and tribulations rescue us who call upon thee with faith.

*Now & ever…:* O all-pure Virgin Mistress, deliver us from all wrath, famine and pestilence, and free us from everlasting torment through the intercession of Artemius.

Kontakion & Ikos of the resurrection.

Ode VII

*Irmos:* The divinely wise youths worshipped not a creation rather than the Creator, but, manfully trampling the threat of the fire underfoot, they rejoice, chanting: Blessed art Thou, the all-hymned God of our fathers!

How shall we praise you, O most lauded ones who surpass our understanding and ability to recount, and who amaze us exceedingly with miracles, for which we cry aloud: O Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

O divinely wise ones, ye in no way loved vanity or the pleasures of life, but considered all of them to be as dung, for ye possessed Christ, to Whom ye cried aloud: O Lord God, blessed art Thou!

How can we fail to hymn the seal and boast of the glorious choir of the unmercenaries, the honored and right wise Thalalæus and Tryphon, who work an unceasing multitude of miracles?

The drops of thy blood were shown to be healing for the faithful, O Thalalæus, washing infirmities away and quenching cruel fevers through the grace of Christ, the Bestower of crowns.

While herding geese in the fields, thou didst receive from God the grace of healings, to cure the weaknesses and infirmities of men, O greatmartyr Tryphon, thou physician who required no fee.

Thy wounds put forth the sweet fragrance of myrrh, O martyr Tryphon, thy blood poureth forth healings, and the remains of thy body sanctify the souls of those who touch them.

*Glory…:* Deliver Thy servants from bodily illness and spiritual weakness, O Thou Who art God in three Hypostases, and preserve us unharmed by all of the temptations of this life.

*Now & ever…:* With the honorable unmercenaries thou everywhere pourest forth streams of healing upon the sick, O Virgin; for the Lord of mercy, Who became incarnate of thee, hath shown thee to be a wellspring of loving-kindness.

Ode VIII

*Irmos:* The birthgiving of the Theotokos saved the pious children in the furnace *—* then in figure, but now in deed *—* and it moveth all the world to chant to Thee: Hymn ye the Lord and exalt Him supremely for all ages!

Holy art Thou, O Almighty One, Who glorifiest Thy saints! For for their sake Thou deliverest the world from misfortunes and dost enlighten those who hymn and exalt Thee supremely forever.

Abiding in the habitations of the Most High, O ever most memorable ones, ye never cease to show mercy to those on earth, and ye do good unto those who hymn and exalt the Lord supremely forever.

Thy union with God, accomplished by thy corrections, O blessed Blaise, hath shown thee to be a benefactor of both reason-endowed and irrational creatures; wherefore, thou hast received gifts of healings.

As a venerable hierarch, O Blaise, thou bearest the wounds of the sufferings of Christ Who gave thee the grace to heal all sicknesses; wherefore, come to our help with thy goodly gifts.

Having illumined thy mind with dispassion and adorned it with humility, O Spyridon, thou wast enriched with the gifts of the Spirit, to drive away evil spirits and loose the infirmities of those who honor thee with faith.

The river of the gifts which abide in thee water every heart, O venerable Spyridon; it giveth health unto all, and restoreth all to the glory of God Who hath glorified thee.

We bless the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit: the Lord.

Merciful art Thou, O indivisible Trinity, for in that Thou art most compassionate, Thou hast mercy upon all. Wherefore, we who are weighed down by sins flee unto Thee, crying: Cleanse Thou Thy servants!

*Now & ever…:* With the unmercenaries, O Mistress, pray for us who have set their hope on thee, that we may be delivered from future condemnation and may be vouchsafed to enter the kingdom of heaven.

Ode IX

*Irmos:* Let every mortal leap for joy, enlightened by the Spirit; and let the nature of the incorporeal intelligences keep festival, honoring the sacred feast of the Mother of God, and let them cry aloud: Rejoice, O most blessed Theotokos, pure Ever-virgin!

Celebrating the memory of our common helpers, we earnestly cry out to thee: From all harm, tribulation and grievous illnesses rescue those who hymn you!

Let us bless Charalampius, the wonderworker among hierarchs and generous helper among passionbearers, the physician of the infirm and dispeller of pestilential plagues.

Thou hast been shown to be a great defender of the faithful and a deliverer from misfortunes, O divinely wise Charalampius; wherefore, from all wrath and pestilence free those who glorify thee.

When thy relics are honored and kissed, ailments of body and soul cease, O Charalampius; for Christ hath given them the ability to heal and to drive away grievous sufferings.

Today let us praise Modestus, the lamp of the Church which hath been set on the lampstand of Sion, who shineth forth with rays of loving-kindness and healeth the diseases of men and cattle.

Thou wast long the shepherd of Jerusalem, and hadst compassion for both reason-endowed and unreasoning creatures; and thou art now a citizen of the city on high, where do thou remember those who commemorate thee.

*Glory…:* O ye unmercenaries who emulated Christ, accept this our meager hymnody, and ask of the Trinity forgiveness for us who are guilty of many sins.

*Now & ever…:* O good Savior, through the entreaties of Thine all-hymned Mother and of all the all-praised unmercenaries, send Thy mercy and help down from heaven upon us who call upon Thee.

Receiving from Christ the skill to heal sufferings of soul and body, O wonderworkers, ye supernaturally heal all with medical cures which are not of man, but are of divine origin, O unmercenaries.

Epistle appointed for the Sunday, and that for the saints: Epistle to the Corinthians, § 153 \(I Cor. 12: 27-13: 8\)

Brethren: Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love never faileth.

Alleluia of the resurrectional tone, and that of the saints, in Tone II—

What is so good or so joyous as for brethren to dwell together in unity?

Gospel appointed for the Sunday, and that of the saints: Gospel according to Matthew, § 34 from the midpoint \(Mt. 10: 1, 5-8\)

At that time, when Jesus had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying: “Go not into the way of the gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.”

Communion verse for Sunday, and that of the saints—
