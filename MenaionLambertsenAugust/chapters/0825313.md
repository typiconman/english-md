*On “Lord, I have cried…”, 6 stichera: 3 for the Apostle Bartholemew, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “As one valiant among the martyrs…”—*

Earnestly let us bless the glorious Bartholemew, the never-setting star of the Sun of great splendor, the animate heaven which proclaimeth the saving glory of God, the divine preacher, the beacon of the nations, the river which poureth forth a stream of understanding and watereth the hearts of the faithful.

Thy paths were revealed in the sea, O apostle, and shown to be beyond the understanding of men; for, cast into the sea in a casket, thou didst make thy way to the West, O most renowned Bartholemew, right glorious martyrs following thee from the East on either side, and rendering homage to thee, at the behest of the Master of all.

With thy wondrous ascents thou didst purify the water, and didst arrive at the island of Lipari, pouring forth myrrh, O glorious one, and healing incurable diseases; and thou becamest for the faithful in that place a savior and refuge, a deliverer and intercessor before the King and Savior of all, O Apostle Bartholemew.

*And 3 stichera of the Apostle Titus, in the same tone: Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast given a sign…”—*

Proclaiming the one Godhead in three Hypostases, thou didst roil the sea of polytheism, and those drowning in the abyss of ungodliness thou didst guide to calm havens, O blessed one. Wherefore, thou hast received heavenly recompense, entreating Him Who loveth mankind, in behalf of those who hymn thee.

Having illumined thy mind with divine radiance, thou didst travel with the sun like a ray thereof, with Paul illumining the benighted, O godly Titus; and with him thou didst deliver the world from deepest night. Wherefore, we call thee blessed, as a God-pleasing hierarch, a divine apostle and fervent ­intercessor.

Hailing from Crete and returning thereto, thou didst establish the true Faith therein as an unshakable foundation, and didst edify the faithful therewith by the divine power of heaven, O blessed Titus, first hierarch of thy homeland, companion of Paul and consolation of the faithful.

*Glory…, in Tone I—*

Forsaking earthly things, thou didst follow after Christ; and having been marked by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, thou wast sent by Him to the nations who were perishing, to turn the people to the light of the knowledge of God, O Apostle Bartholemew. And having completed the divine feats of thy suffering and undergone divers tortures, thou didst surrender thy soul to Christ, Whom do thou entreat, O most blessed one, that He grant us great mercy.

*Now & ever…: theotokion, or this stavro­theotokion—*

She who knew not wedlock, beholding Thee nailed to the tree of the Cross, O Jesus, said, weeping: “O my sweet Child, Thou unapproachable Light of the all-unoriginate Father, wherefore hast Thou forsaken me who alone gave Thee birth? Haste Thou, and glorify Thyself, that those who glorify Thy divine sufferings may receive divine glory!”

*Troparion, in Tone III—*

O holy apostles, entreat the merciful God, that He grant to our souls remission of ­transgressions.

The Rock of life hath shown thee to be an all-precious rock, whereon He hath founded His Church, O Bartholemew, apostle of the Lord. Wherefore, we honor thee and call thee blessed.

In manner transcending mind and thought thou didst learn the things that are great, discovering the hypostatic Wisdom; and, making the ends of the earth wise with divine teachings, thou didst show the wisdom of the Greeks to be foolish.

Though thy lifeless body was encoffined, thou didst traverse the sea, obedient to the commands of God, O apostle; and like the sun thou didst pass from the East to the West, illumining it.

*Theotokion:* He Who is full emptieth Himself; the Preëternal One beginneth, born of the divine Virgin Maiden. Him didst thou proclaim in two natures but a single hypostasis, O divinely blessed one.

The grace of the Spirit, enriching thee with every gift, O all-glorious Titus, sent thee to preach the incarnation of the Word to the ends of the earth.

The all-wise Paul, full of the gifts of the Spirit, laid his hands on thee, O all-wondrous Titus, ordaining thee as a minister and disciple of God and a preacher of the Faith.

Thou wast the mouth of God the Word, O glorious Apostle Bartholemew, and hast delivered men from the mouth of the wicked wolf, bringing them to thy Master through the font of baptism.

Having burned up the bitter tinder of falsehood with thy fiery tongue, O all-wise one, thou hast restored hardened hearts and made them receptive to heavenly understanding.

*Theotokion:* God the Word Who, in manner past recounting, was well-pleased to be born of thee in the flesh, O pure Virgin Mother, chose the glorious Bartholemew as His disciple and close servant.

*Canon of the Apostle Titus*
{{text_align=center}}

*Irmos:* Neither in wisdom, nor in power, nor yet in riches do we boast, but in Thee, O Christ, the hypostatic Wisdom of the Father; for none is holy save Thee, O Thou Who lovest mankind.

Not by wisdom didst thou render foolish those who were attentive thereto, O blessed one; rather by an understanding of the Truth thou didst drive away the blindness of the souls of those who have recourse unto thee.

With the scythe of God thou didst clear the inheritance of the nations, the furrow choked with the thorns of ungodliness, sowing therein the seed of understanding.

Preaching the one Godhead in three Persons, O blessed one, thou didst drive away the gloom of polytheism, leading the ends of the earth to divine understanding.

*Theotokion:* He Who was born of thee in the flesh hath made thee holier than the angels and more exalted than all creation; wherefore, we honor thee as the Mistress of all.

*Kontakion of the Apostle Titus, in Tone II: Spec. Mel.: “Seeking the highest…”—*

Revealed as a companion of Paul, O ever-memorable Apostle Titus, thou recounter of sacred mysteries, with him thou didst preach to us the words of divine grace. Wherefore, we cry out to thee: Cease thou never to pray for us all!

*Sessional hymn of the Apostle Bartholemew, in Tone III: Spec. Mel.: “Of the divine…”—*

O Apostle Bartholemew, thou hast been shown to be a treasure of the Church which cannot be stolen, an unshakable pillar of piety; and setting thy path in the sea, thou pourest forth an abyss of divine healings. O right glorious one, entreat Christ God, that He grant us great mercy.

*Glory…: Sessional hymn of the Apostle Titus, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “Of the Wisdom…”—*

Like a star with the sun, thou didst travel with Paul, O all-glorious Titus; and ye manifestly illumined the earth and destroyed the darkness. Settling in the island of Crete, O blessed one, in death thou didst leave thy pangs and discourses behind for all, like never-fading beams of light, O divinely wise one; and, illumined thereby, we piously honor and cry out to thee together: Entreat Christ God, that He grant remission of sins unto those who honor thy holy memory with love.

*Now & ever…: Theotokion—*

O all-hymned one, most immaculate Bride of the Creator, Mother of the Deliverer, who knewest not man, receptacle of the Comforter: haste thou to deliver me, who am the vile abode of iniquity and in mind am become the plaything of the demons, from their evil wiles; and make me the splendid dwelling-place of the virtues, O radiant one untouched by corruption. Drive away the clouds of the passions and vouchsafe that, by thy supplications, I may receive a portion on high and share in the never-waning light.

*Stavrotheotokion—*

The ewe-lamb, beholding the Lamb, Shepherd and Deliverer upon the Cross, exclaimed, weeping, and bitterly lamenting, cried out: “The world rejoiceth, receiving deliverance through Thee; but my womb doth burn, beholding Thy crucifixion, which Thou endurest in the loving-kindness of Thy mercy. O long-suffering Lord, unfathomable abyss and wellspring of mercy, have pity and grant remission of offenses unto those who hymn Thy divine sufferings with faith!”

The sayings of the prophets have received their fulfillment; for the divinely eloquent disciple hath gone as a light to preserve the nations, illumining all the ends of the world.

Illumined with divine light, O glorious one, thou wast shown to be a secondary luminary by divine communion, ministering from the beginning to Him Who abased Himself to assume flesh for our sake.

Deliver thy flock from the storm of sin, from misfortunes and tribulations at the hands of the adversary, O glorious one, ever guiding us to the havens of salvation with grace.

*Irmos:* Seated in glory upon the throne of the Godhead, Jesus most divine hath come on a light cloud, and with His incorrupt arm hath saved those who cry: Glory to Thy power, O Christ!

Drawing from inexhaustible treasuries, O most wise and glorious one, thou didst fill hungry minds with a true wealth of understanding, and hast brought life to dead hearts, driving away the darkness of ignorance.

The net of Paul ensnared thee by the grace of providence, O Titus, and in time thou didst diligently draw many nations forth from the depths of deception into piety with the hook of thy discourse.

Following the glorious and godly Paul like a lamb, O divinely eloquent one, thou didst drive away the wolves of evil. Thou hast cast the temples of the idols to the ground and made men temples of God.

Acquiring beautiful feet through thy preaching, thou didst proclaim the glad tidings unto all, O blessed one, and didst announce peace to the world, banishing the ancient enmity by divine teachings, O apostle of the Savior.

Thy discourse was healing for those who had received the deadly venom of the serpent, O Bartholemew; and, in accordance with the prophecy, the ground of the impious split asunder at the proclamation of thine all-wise doctrines.

Traversing the unfathomable depths upborne on the crests of the waves of the sea, with the divine martyrs, O Apostle Bartholemew, thou didst arrive at the island of Lipari, pouring forth abundant life upon a man many days dead.

*Theotokion:* Rejoicing, I truly glorify thee, the all-pure Mother of God, and I cry out to thee like the angel, O blessed one full of joy, awesome report and saying, thou strange receptacle of the Master of creation.

*Canon of the Apostle Titus*
{{text_align=center}}

*Irmos:* The ungodly perceive not Thy glory, O Christ; but, waking at dawn out of the night, we hymn Thee, O Only-begotten One Who lovest mankind, Thou effulgence of the glory of the Father’s divinity.

Like an excellent physician and as a minister of grace, thou didst bind up the fœtid and evil wounds of the souls of the gentiles, O blessed one, with the sweet salt of thy divine ­discourses.

Meekly submitting to the precepts of Paul, O all-wise and most honored herald of God, with him thou didst travel about the world, proclaiming words of understanding.

Teaching the Word Who is equally active and equally enthroned with the Father, O divinely eloquent one, as one wise thou didst subdue the vain-minded ones, causing them to cast aside all the falsehood of idolatry.

*Ikos:* Having passed over the earth like a sun of great radiance, illumining it with the rays of thy discourses, thou didst set, dying a martyr’s death; and with the splendor which issueth forth from thy tomb thou didst dispel the darkness of the passions. Wherefore, those consumed with envy, driving thee like the sun toward the West, O passion-bearer, set thee afloat on the sea; and a wonder most great was beheld in thee, who in awesome manner sailed the depths of the sea in a wondrous voyage, O Bartholemew, apostle of the Lord.

Mankind, rendered foolish through wickedness, O all-glorious one, didst thou heal with the sweet savor of thy words; and thou didst give them the faith to chant: O all-hymned Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

Like heaven all-high, with an exalted voice as a divine apostle thou dost noetically proclaim the glory of God, to Whom we cry: O all-hymned Lord God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

Instructed by thee, O disciple and recounter of ineffable mysteries, those dead in soul who worshipped inanimate matter came to acknowledge God, the Bestower of life, Who was put to death for our sake.

As a servant of the Truth, thou wast shown to be a dispeller of falsehood, O glorious one; and as a disciple of Paul, thou didst endure persecutions and tribulations, chanting with him: Blessed is the God of our fathers!

**AT LITURGY**

*Prokimenon, in Tone VIII—*

Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

*Stichos:* The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaimeth the work of His hands.

**Epistle to Titus, §300**
{{text_align=center}}

**\[Tit. 1: 1-4, 2: 15-3: 3, 12-13, 15\]**
{{text_align=center}}

Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the Truth which is after godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, Who cannot lie, promised before the world began, but hath in due times manifested His word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God, our Savior; to Titus, mine own son after the common Faith: Grace, mercy and peace, from God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men. For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me at Nicopolis; for I have determined there to winter. Bring Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. All that are with me greet thee. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

*Alleluia, in Tone I—*

*Stichos:* The heavens shall confess Thy wonders, O Lord, and Thy truth in the congregation of the saints.

*Stichos:* God is glorified in the council of the saints.

**Reading from the Gospel according to Matthew §11 \[5:14-19\]**
{{text_align=center}}

The Lord said to His disciples: “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Who is in heaven. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”

*Communion Verse—*

Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
