At “Lord, I have cried…”, 10 stichera: ­­3 stichera for the Indiction, in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: “Joy of the ranks of heaven…”—

Having prayerfully learned the right glorious and divine teaching of Christ, every day let us cry out to the Creator: Our Father, Who dwellest in the heavens, give us our daily bread, overlooking our transgressions.

O Christ God, Who once on Mount Sinai didst inscribe the tablets, now in the flesh in the city of Nazareth Thou hast Thyself received the book of the prophet to read of God, and unrolling it Thou hast taught the people so as to fulfill that which was written concerning Thee.

As once in the wilderness the bodies of the Jews who did not truly subject themselves to Thee, the Master of all, fell into the abyss as was fitting; so now with psalmody do Thou scatter the bones of the impious and unbelieving Hagarenes in hell, O Christ.

And these 3 stichera of the venerable one, in Tone V: Spec. Mel.: “O venerable father…”—

O venerable father, were it possible for thy pillar to speak, it would not cease to hymn thy pangs, labors and lamentations. For, rather than bearing, it was borne, like a tree watered by thy tears. The angels were amazed, men marvelled, and the demons were in terror of thy patience, O venerable Symeon. Pray that our souls be saved!

O venerable father, emulating thy Master through the power of the divine Spirit, thou didst mount thy pillar as though it were a cross. He rent asunder the handwriting of the sins of all, and thou didst put down the uprisings of the passions. He was like a lamb, and thou wast like an immolation. He ascended the Cross; thou, the pillar. O venerable Symeon: pray that our souls be saved!

O venerable father, having drenched thy body with tears and cleansed thy soul, thou didst scale the heights of the virtues. Wherefore, making thy pillar a material habitation and heavenly Sion thy noetic and heavenly city, thou didst by thy virtues astound the angels and didst strike men with awe, and didst put the demons to shame. O venerable Symeon: pray that our souls be saved!

And these other stichera of the saint, in Tone II—

The sacred Symeon sprang forth as good fruit from goodly stock, nurtured from infancy more by grace than by milk. And, lifting up his body upon the pillar of stone, and elevating his mind up to God, he fashioned a heavenly dwelling-place with his virtues; and dancing in chorus with the divine powers, he became an abode of Christ God, the Savior of our souls.

Thy memory and the meekness of thy heart abide forever, O venerable father Symeon, blessed favorite of Christ, for though thou hast departed from us, O good pastor, yet in spirit thou dost not leave us, interceding in love before God, and joining chorus with the angels in the heavens. With them do thou pray that our souls be saved.

*By Cyprian—* O all-praised father, the shrine of thy relics poureth forth healings, and thy holy soul, united with the angels, doth rejoice as is meet. Wherefore, O venerable one, having boldness before the Lord, and holding chorus with the incorporeal ones in the heavens, with them do thou pray that our souls be saved.

*By Germanus—* O God-bearer, thou didst love the most exalted philosophy and wast beyond the world, dwelling above visible things, and didst show thyself to be a divine and undefiled mirror of God. Ever united to the light, thou didst receive the light and a most notable end, O blessed one. Pray thou in behalf of our souls, O wise Symeon.

Glory…: in Tone VI, by Germanus—

Grace divine doth overshadow the shrine of thy relics, O sanctified Symeon. Wherefore, having recourse to the fragrance of the myrrh of thy miracles, we draw forth healing for our infirmities. O venerable father, entreat Christ God in behalf of our souls.

Now and ever…: of the Indiction, in the same tone: the composition of the Byzantine—

O unoriginate Word and Son, Who art united with the Holy Spirit, Creator and Fashioner of all things visible and invisible: bless Thou the crown of the year, preserving the multitude of the Orthodox in peace, through the prayers of the Theotokos and of all Thy saints.

Entrance, Prokimenon of the day, and three readings:

Two for the New Year:

The Reading from the Prophecy of Isaiah \(61:1-9\)

The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; He hath send me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto those who mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called Trees of righteousness, The planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified. And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the wasted cities, the desolations of many generations. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and vinedressers. But ye shall be named The priests of the Lord; men shall call you The ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them. For I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.

The Reading from the Book of Leviticus \(26:3-12, 14-17, 19-24\)

If ye walk in my statues, and keep my commandments, and do them; then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgements, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. And I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass; and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate. And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish ye yet seven times for your sins.

One for St. Symeon:

The Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon \(4:7-15\)

But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. For honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age. He pleased God, and was loved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated. Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind. He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time: for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked. This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen.

At the Aposticha, these stichera for the Indiction, in Tone I: the composition of John the Monk—

The New Year hath dawned, summoning all to honor those who enlighten it: Callista, Evodus and Hermogenes, the sibling sufferers; Symeon, the equal of the angels; and Joshua, son of Nun; the seven youths of Ephesus, and the choir of martyred women forty times radiant: sharing in whose memory, O ye that love the feasts of the Church, let us piously cry out: bless, O Lord, the works of Thy hands, and vouchsafe us safely to pass through the cycles of the year.

*Stichos:* To Thee is due praise, O God, in Sion; and unto Thee shall a vow be rendered in Jerusalem.

O Christ our God, Who hast made all things in wisdom and hast brought into existence things that were not: bless Thou the crown of the year and preserve our cities unharmed; gladden all right-believing Christians with Thy strength, granting them victory over their adversaries, and bestowing great mercy upon the world, for the sake of the Theotokos.

In Tone II—

*Stichos:* We shall be filled with the good things of Thy house; holy is Thy temple, wonderful in righteousness.

*By Cyprian—* Wondrous art Thou, O Lord, and wondrous are Thy works, and Thy ways are inscrutable, for Thou art the Wisdom of God, the perfect Hypostasis and Power, equally unoriginate and equally ever-existent: and by Thy creative and omnipotent authority Thou didst ineffably enter the world through Thy Mother who kneweth not man, seeking to benefit Thy creation, not altering in Thy divinity, appointing the times and seasons for our salvation, O Immutable One. Wherefore, we cry unto Thee: O good Lord, glory to Thee!

*Stichos:* Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with Thy goodness, O Lord.

*By the Damascene—* O preëternal Word of the Father, Who created all things in wisdom and fashioned every creature by Thine almighty word: bless Thou the crown of the year with Thy goodness, and for the sake of the Theotokos, set heresies at nought, for Thou art good and lovest mankind.

Glory…: of the saint, in Tone V—

O venerable father, thou didst discover a good ladder, whereby thou didst ascend on High as on the fiery chariot which Elijah found. Though he did not leave the means of his ascent behind for others, yet even after death thou hast thy pillar. O heavenly man, earthly angel, inextinguishable beacon for the world, venerable Symeon: pray that our souls be saved!

Now and ever…, in the same tone, by John the Monk—

O Thou that art ever King and abidest for endless ages: accept the supplication of sinners entreating salvation, O Thou Who lovest mankind, and grant fertility unto Thine earth, bestowing seasonable weather thereon; on behalf of Orthodox Christians contend Thou against the godless barbarians, as once Thou didst for David, when they came to Thine habitations and defiled the most holy place, O Savior. And through the prayers of the Theotokos, grant Thou victories to them, O Christ God, for Thou art the victory and boast of the Orthodox.

Troparion of the Indiction, in Tone II—

O Fashioner of all creation, Who in Thine authority hast appointed the times and seasons: bless Thou the crown of the year with Thy goodness, O Lord, preserving in peace Orthodox Christians and Thy city, and save us through the prayers of the Theotokos.

Glory…: of the venerable one, in Tone I—

Thou wast a pillar of patience, O venerable one, emulating the forefathers: Job, in afflictions; Joseph, in temptations, and the life of the incorporeal hosts while in the body. O Symeon our father, entreat Christ God that our souls be saved.

Now and ever…: to the Theotokos, in the same tone—

Rejoice, O highly-favored Virgin Mary, haven and intercession of the human race, for from thee was the Deliverer of the world incarnate, for thou alone art Mother and Virgin, ever-blessed and most glorified. Entreat Christ God that He grant peace unto the whole world.

At Matins

At “God is the Lord…”, the troparion of the Indiction, twice; Glory…, that of the saint; Now and ever…, that of the Theotokos.

After the first chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymn of the Indiction, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Joseph marvelled…”—

In faith we fall down before thee, as before the Master of all and Bestower of blessings, earnestly crying aloud: O Savior, be thou entreated in Thy loving-kindness by the supplications of her who gave Thee birth and of all who have ever been well-pleasing unto Thee; and in that Thou art good, vouchsafe a good year unto those who worship Thee in two natures and glorify Thee with faith.

Glory…: Sessional hymn of the venerable one, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “Of the wisdom…”—

Taking up the Cross of the Lord, O wise one, and following after Him unto the end, thou didst not turn thy mind back to the world, O divinely wise one. Having slain the passions by abstinence and labors, thou didst prepare thyself as a temple for thy Lord. Wherefore, thou hast received a reward of heavenly gifts: to heal the afflicted and cast out evil spirits. O Symeon most venerable, entreat Christ God, that He grant remission of sins unto those who celebrate thy holy memory with love.

Now and ever…: the Sessional hymn of the Indiction, “As to the Master of all…” is repeated.

After the second chanting of the Psalter, this Sessional hymn, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “Of the wisdom…”—

Having trained thy soul in godly manner by abstinence, labors and prayers, thou didst become a companion of the martyrs, O blessed one, and didst truly receive gifts of miracles to heal the infirmities of those who faithfully honor thee. Wherefore, thou dost expel legions of demons by the authority given thee against them from on high. O all-blessed Symeon, entreat Christ God, that He grant remission of transgressions unto those who celebrate thy holy memory with love.

Glory…, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Go thou quickly before…”—

Thou didst faithfully enter upon the struggle of torment, O Callista, preaching Christ our God with thy two brethren; for, thyself nurtured with hope, thou didst truly make of them noetic vessels of the Church of Christ. Wherefore, thou hast joined thyself unto them in the life on high, O martyr.

Now and ever…: Theotokion—

Speedily accept thou our supplications, O Mistress, and bear them to thy Son and God, O Lady most pure. Loose thou the evil circumstances which surround those who have recourse unto thee, and crush the attacks and audacity of those who now array themselves against thy servants, O Virgin.

If it be a temple dedicated to the venerable Symeon, after the Polyeleos, this Sessional hymn to the venerable one, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “Of the Wisdom…”—

Thou didst excel in faith, O wise father, and disdaining all transitory things, by the power of the Spirit thou didst follow Christ. With abstinence didst thou lay waste to thy body, O venerable one, ever looking toward the glory of Heaven. Wherefore, thou didst find thy pillar a ladder of divine ascent, fitting thy desire, O most sacred Symeon. Entreat Christ God, that He grant remission of offenses unto those who faithfully celebrate thy holy memory.

Glory…, in Tone V: Spec. Mel.: “The Word Who with the Father and the Spirit is equally without beginning”—

Thou didst adorn thy life with abstinence, mortifying thy body. Thou didst in no wise heed the attacks of the enemy, O blessed father, and didst depart unto God and everlasting life as a worthy heir. Wherefore, cease thou never to pray that our souls receive mercy.

Now and ever…, Theotokion—

O all-holy Virgin, have mercy on us who have recourse to thee who are compassionate and who entreat thy fervent aid; for, as thou art good, thou canst save all by thy maternal entreaties, in that thou art the Mother of God Most High, and thou dost ever beseech Him, O divinely gracious one.

O God-bearing Symeon, by thine entreaties grant the divinely conferred light of knowledge unto me who with the vile organ of my tongue weave a hymn for thee.

Full of spiritual grace, being, like Jacob, David and Moses, from shepherd lands, thou wast shown to be a leader of the flocks of the Word, O blessed one.

*Theotokion:* O all-pure Theotokos, rejoice! O honored one, who in thy womb didst contain the infinite God, ask that those who hymn thee be delivered from grievous circumstances.

For, in that Thou art mighty, Thou didst bring all things from nonexistence into being.

Another Sessional hymn, of the venerable one, in the same tone and melody—

Making of thy pillar a fiery chariot, searching the heights thou didst unite thyself to those who are on High. Wherefore, thou wast a converser with angels, O venerable one, praying unceasingly with them to Christ God in behalf of us all.

*Ikos:* What human tongue can ever suffice to confess in praise the unblemished life of Symeon? Yet, by the wisdom of God, I shall hymn the suffering and struggles on earth of this mighty giant; for he was shown to be a beacon to all men in his great patience, and hath shone forth in the angelic choir; for, unceasingly hymning Christ with them, and having acquired purity through abstinence, he ­prayeth without ceasing for us all.

O Word of God, Power, true and hypostatic Wisdom, Who sustainest and directest all things wisely: do Thou now peacefully order the season which hath dawned for Thy servants.

Exapostilarion of the Indiction: Spec. Mel.: “To the disciples…”—

O Lord and God of gods, Being of three Hypostases, unapproachable, uncreated, almighty Creator and Ruler of all: before Thee do we all fall down, and Thee do we entreat: blessing this beginning year, in that Thou art good, do Thou preserve Orthodox Christians and all Thy people in peace, O Compassionate One.

Glory…: Exapostilarion of the venerable one, in the same melody—

Thy life, O venerable one, which shone like a radiant beacon, hath illumined all the world with rays of miracles; for, praying for us who honor thee, O blessed one, by thy pillar thou didst ascend unto God as by a ladder, to that place where there is truly the ultimate fulfillment of all desires, O Symeon.

Now and ever…: Exapostilarion of the Indiction, in the same melody—

O Maker and Ruler of all creation, Who in Thine authority hast fixed the times and seasons: crown the cycles of the year with blessings of goodness, O Compassionate One, preserving Thy people in peace, unharmed and whole, we pray, through the supplications of her who gave birth to Thee, and of the divine angels.

On the Praises, 4 stichera for the Indiction, the composition of John the Monk—

*In Tone III:* O preëternal Word of the Father, Who art in the image of God, and Who, in Thine authority, hast fixed the times and seasons: Bless Thou the crown of the year with Thy goodness, granting peace unto Thy Churches and victories to Orthodox Christians, fertility to the earth and great mercy to us.

*In Tone IV:* Thy Kingdom is the Kingdom of all ages, O Christ God, and Thy dominion continueth through all generations; for Thou hast fashioned all things in wisdom, fixing the times and seasons for us. Wherefore, giving thanks for all things, we cry out: Bless Thou the crown of the year with Thy goodness, and vouchsafe us to cry aloud to Thee without condemnation: Glory to Thee, O Lord!

*By Andrew of Pyrrhus:* Thy journeys are great and wondrous journeyings, O God. Wherefore, we magnify the power of Thy dispensation: for, being Light of Light, Thou didst come to Thy wretched world and didst destroy the primeval curse of ancient Adam, as Thou wast well pleased so to do, O Word; and in Thy wisdom Thou hast appointed times and seasons for us, that we may glorify Thy goodness, which accomplisheth all things. O Lord, glory be to Thee!

Sticheron of the holy martyrs, by Germanus, in Tone II—

When by Thy Passion, O Lord, Thou didst establish the whole world, then were the weak girded about with power, and women stood forth manfully against the most cruel tyrant and won a maternal victory; and they entered into the delight of paradise, unto the glory of Thee Who wast born of women and hast saved the human race.

Glory…, of the venerable one, in the same tone—

The sacred Symeon sprang forth as good fruit from goodly stock, nurtured from infancy more by grace than by milk. And lifting up his holy body upon the pillar of stone, and elevating his mind up to God, he fashioned a heavenly dwelling-place with his virtues; and joining chorus with the hosts of God, he became an abode of Christ, the Savior of our souls.

Now and ever…, of the Indiction, in Tone VIII, the composition of Germanus—

O Christ, Word and God, Who hast created all things in Thine ineffable wisdom, and hast appointed times and seasons for us: bless Thou the works of Thy hands and with Thy power make glad all right-believing Christians, granting them might against the barbarians, in that Thou alone art good and lovest mankind.

Great is our Lord, and great is His strength, and of His understanding there is no measure.

And of the venerable one, in Tone VII—

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

Epistle for the Indiction:

Epistle to Timothy, §282 \(I Tim 2:1-15\)

Child Timothy: I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, Who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle \(I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not\), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but \(which becometh women professing godliness\) with good works. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

Epistle for the Venerable One:

Epistle to the Colossians, §258 \(Col 3:12-16\)

Brethren: Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

Alleluia, in Tone IV—

To Thee is due praise, O God, in Sion; and unto Thee shall a vow be rendered in Jerusalem.

*Stichos:* Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with Thy goodness.

Stichos of the venerable one:

Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; in His commandments shall he greatly delight.

For the Indiction:

Gospel according to St. Luke, §13

\(Lk 4:16-22\)

And Jesus came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it is written: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And He closed the book, and He gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all those who were in the synagogue were fastened on Him. And He began to say unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears. And all bare Him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s Son?

For the Venerable One:

Gospel according to St. Matthew, §43

\(Matt 11:27-30\)

All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

Communion Hymns—

Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with Thy goodness.

In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings.
