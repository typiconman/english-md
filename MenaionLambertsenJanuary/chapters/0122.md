{{text_align=center}}

**Troparion Tone 4**

Today a light adorns our *cit*y,/ having within it thy holy relics, O Holy Martyr Ale*xan*der;/ for which sake pray to *Christ* God/ that He deliver us from all tribu*la*tions,/ for gathered together in love we celebrate thy radiant *mem*ory/ imitating thy *bra*very,// standing against the godless powers and *en*emies.

**Kontakion Tone 4**

From thy mother thou didst inherit the *love* of Christ,/ and through the love of thy care-giver thou wast nourished in the fear of God, O all-*glo*rious one,/ to Whom thou didst give thyself, O all-honourable Ale*xan*der,/ and thou dost diligently pray with the *a*ngels.// Beseech on behalf of all who honour thy memory for*give*ness of their sins.

**Magnification**

We magnify thee, O Holy Passion-bearer Alexander; and we honour thy holy sufferings, which thou hast endured for the sake of Christ.
