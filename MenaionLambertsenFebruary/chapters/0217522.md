Also on The 17th Day of the Month of February

Commemoration of the Holy Hieromartyr Hermogenes, Patriarch of Moscow & All Russia

At Little Vespers

On “Lord, I have cried…”, 4 stichera, in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: “O all-praised martyrs…”—

O all-praised martyr Hermogenes, prison could not conceal thee, but the grace of the Spirit of God received thee. Thou wast filled with the spirit of understanding, and didst contemplate the kingdom of God which was within thee. Pray thou to Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy. *Twice*

O all-praised martyr Hermogenes, prison could not conceal thee, for thou didst sit therein as upon a throne, and while incarcerated therein thou didst open thy mouth; and didst call upon all Russia to fight for Faith and homeland. Pray thou to Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

O all-praised martyr Hermogenes, prison could not wear thee out, but the great zeal of God seized upon thee, and thou wast filled with fire which would devour the adversary; and while incarcerated in thy dungeon, thou didst shine before God like a lamp. Pray thou to Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same melody—

Today the hieromartyr Hermogenes standeth before the Mother of God and with us and for us he doth invisibly pray: “O fervent ally, help, save and have mercy on Orthodox Russia, and preserve it beneath the protection of thy goodness!”

At the Aposticha, these stichera, in Tone II: Spec. Mel.: “O house of Ephratha…”—

O city of Moscow, heart of Orthodox Russia, city of great hierarchs, be thou adorned by the new wonder-worker Hermogenes.

*Stichos:* Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

O house of gloom, O house of holiness wherein the holy hierarch reposed, be thou glad, for thou hast found grace: the throne of the temple of God.

*Stichos:* In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings.

O sacred house, O holy tomb, glory of the Orthodox, throw thyself open, and be thou a wellspring of ever-flowing life!

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same melody—

O fervent helper, Mother of our God, pure intercessor: with the holy hierarch entreat thy Son in behalf of thy servants.

Troparion, in Tone IV—

O foremost hierarch of the Russian land and tireless advocate for it before God, laying down thy life for the Faith of Christ and thy flock, thou didst deliver thy land from ungodliness. Wherefore, we cry aloud unto thee: Save us by thy supplications, O hieromartyr Hermogenes our father!

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone—

The mystery hidden from before the ages and unknown even to the angels, through thee, O Theotokos, hath been revealed to those on earth: God incarnate in unconfused union, Who willingly accepted the Cross for our sake and, thereby raising up the first-formed man, hath saved our souls from death.

AT GREAT VESPERS

After the Introductory Psalm, we chant “Blessed is the man…”, the first antiphon.

On “Lord, I have cried…”, 8 stichera, in Tone III—

The voice of the Holy Orthodox Church crieth out with loving compunction: Come ye, my children, for whom I care! Come ye to the great holy hierarch! Come ye to the all-wondrous hieromartyr! Come ye to the tireless advocate for Russia! Fall down and pray from the depths of your souls: O hieromartyr Hermogenes, by thy supplications even now save Orthodox Russia, which thou dost love! *Twice*

Who is this who in compunction hath bent the knees of his body and soul? Who is this who hath fallen prostrate? Who is this who with hope hath uplifted his eyes to heaven and raised up his hands in steadfast trust? Who is this who groaneth and maketh lamentation? As thou dost grieve for our land, O hieromartyr Hermogenes, transform our tears into joy.

O Lord and Savior, if we had not had thy holy hieromartyr Hermogenes as our advocate, and Thy goodness to have mercy on us, how would we dare to stand before Thy face in our sins, even unto this day? How would we have dared to stand against our enemies, preserve the Faith of our fathers, and make steadfast our Orthodox land? But thou didst hearken unto the supplication of the great hierarch, the all-wondrous hieromartyr Hermogenes, and didst gather Orthodox Russia beneath his wings: and its enemies fled from before its face. And now, through the prayers of the holy hierarch, have pity and save us, O Lord!

“Living and active is the word of the Lord: ‘Fear not those who slay the body, but are unable to slay the soul; but fear rather Him who is able to destroy soul and body in Gehenna.’” Thy soul endured patiently because of these words, O hieromartyr Hermogenes. “I fear Him alone Who liveth in the heavens,” thou didst say to the iniquitous traitors; “What is imprisonment to me? It is the sweetness of solitary prayer! What to me are cold and hunger? They are the mortification of a sinful life. What is death to me? It is the joy of departing unto Christ! I am not afraid of the fear of death; I endure all for the sake of Him Who hath loved me: I endure, and seek not to escape it, for the salvation of Russia is from the Orthodox Church! Understand this, and submit yourselves, for God is with us by His grace!”

Understand, ye nations, and submit yourselves! Hearken ye unto the ends of the earth! For if ye again strengthen yourselves, ye shall again be vanquished! For the eyes of the holy hierarch Hermogenes, who standeth guard over Orthodox Russia, do not slumber, his mouth falleth not silent in the defense of the Truth, and his heart keepeth watch from the morning until the night, as he trusteth in the Lord and prayeth: “Let Him exalt the Orthodox Church in Russia, and strengthen the land of Russia forever!”

“The sins of Russia overtook it, the floods of its iniquities cast it into confusion; for iniquity had been added to iniquity, and it was destroyed because of its iniquity; yet it turned to the Lord, and was saved when the holy hierarch Hermogenes preached, issuing a call to repentance, saying: “Come ye children, hearken unto me! Confess ye your sins and humble yourselves amid your iniquities! For the Lord loveth the humble of heart and receiveth the contrite of spirit: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is great deliverance!”

Through the supplications of the holy hierarch Hermogenes, the Lord hath accepted the repentance of those who utter lamentation before Him, and hath confirmed His mercy upon those who fear Him. And, lo! throughout Russia they rejoice in the Lord and are glad in the Holy Spirit, they boast in the power of Christ and are magnified by the glory of the Holy Church. The people meditate upon heavenly things, seeking the Jerusalem on High. The truth of Orthodoxy is announced to the people for the salvation of the whole land. Thus doth the truth of the Lord abide in our generation, and His mercy is confirmed upon us!

Glory…, in Tone I—

Come, all ye faithful, let us praise the holy hierarch Hermogenes: the star who shone forth from the east of the sun’s dawning and illumined the west of the sun’s setting with Orthodoxy of faith, the new star, now revealed in the glorious heavens among the company of hieromartyrs, to aid his Church and homeland against their enemies, and to confirm the Faith of our fathers. Through the supplications of the holy hierarch, O Lord, grant us peace and great mercy.

Now & ever…: Dogmatic theotokion, in the same tone—

Let us hymn the Virgin Mary, the glory of the whole world, who sprang forth from men and gave birth unto the Master, the portal of heaven, and the subject of the hymnody of the incorporeal hosts; for she hath been shown to be heaven and the temple of the Godhead. Having destroyed the middle-wall of enmity, she hath brought forth peace and opened wide the kingdom. Therefore, having her as the confirmation of our faith, we have as champion the Lord born of her. Be of good courage! Yea, be ye of good cheer, O people of God, for He vanquisheth the foe, in that He is almighty!

Entrance. Prokimenon of the day. Three Readings—

A Reading from Proverbs

The memory of the just is praised, and the blessing of the Lord is upon his head. Blessed is the man who hath found wisdom, and the mortal who knoweth prudence. For it is better to traffic for her, than for treasures of gold and silver. And she is more valuable than precious stones: no precious thing is equal to her in value. For length of existence and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and glory: out of her mouth righteousness proceedeth, and she carrieth law and mercy upon her tongue. Hearken to me, O children, for I will speak solemn truths. Blessed is the man who shall keep my ways; for my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and in them is prepared favor from the Lord. Ye, O men, do I exhort; and utter my voice to the sons of men. I, wisdom, have built up; upon counsel, knowledge and understanding have I called. Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and strength is mine. I love those that love me; they that seek me shall find grace. O ye simple, understand subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge. Hearken unto me again; for I will speak solemn truths. For my throat shall meditate truth; and false lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or perverse. They are all evident to those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge. For I will instruct you in truth, that your hope may be in the Lord, and ye may be filled with the Spirit.

A Reading from Proverbs

The mouth of the righteous droppeth wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall perish. The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse. False balances are an abomination before the Lord: but a just weight is acceptable unto Him. Wherever pride entereth, there will also disgrace: but the mouth of the humble doth meditate wisdom. The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the overthrow of the rebellious shall spoil them. Possessions shall not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness will deliver from death. When a just man dieth, he leaveth regret: but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and causeth joy. Righteousness traceth out blameless paths: but ungodliness encountereth unjust dealing. The righteousness of upright men delivereth them: but transgressors are caught in their own destruction. At the death of a just man his hope doth not perish: but the boast of the ungodly perisheth. A righteous man escapeth from a snare, and the ungodly man is delivered up in his place. In the mouth of ungodly men is a snare for citizens: but the understanding of righteous men is prosperous. In the prosperity of righteous men a city prospereth, but at the destruction of the wicked there is exultation. At the blessing of the upright a city shall be exalted, but by the mouths of ungodly men it is overthrown. A man void of understanding sneereth at his fellow citizens: but a sensible man is quiet.

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

Though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. For honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him; so that, living among sinners, he was translated. Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of lust doth undermine the simple mind. He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time; for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted He to take him away from among the wicked. This the people saw, and understood not, neither laid they up this in their minds: that His grace and mercy is with His saints, and that He doth visit His chosen.

At the Litia, the sticheron of the temple, and this sticheron of the hieromartyr, idiomelon, in Tone I—

What is this festival? What is this great cry of the sacred assembly? What is this right laudable and beautiful council? Priests rejoice, the people array themselves in gladness, and all Orthodox Russia doth celebrate as the holy hierarch Hermogenes lieth before us, blesseth all from the shrine of his relics, graciously comforteth all and mystically saith: “Fear not, little flock! The ship of Jesus shall not founder in the sea of life, and Orthodox Russia, beloved of God, shall not perish! The Lord hath been pleased to grant us power, for we stand on the rock of faith and righteousness!”

Glory…, in Tone VIII—

What shall we call thee, O holy hierarch Hermogenes? Angel, for thou wast the guardian of Orthodox Russia. Or apostle, for thou didst lay down thy life for the Orthodox Faith for the sake of Christ. Him do thou beseech, that He have mercy on our souls.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone—

Let us hasten now to the Mother of the Lord Most High, and with the holy hierarch Hermogenes let us hymn our fervent helper, for she entreateth her Son, Christ our God, in behalf of all, and causeth all to be saved who have recourse to her mighty protection.

At the aposticha, these stichera, in Tone VI: Spec. Mel.: “On the third day…”—

O holy hierarch Hermogenes, we beseech thee: Look down upon Russia and visit it with thy supplication: “O Lord, let the enemies of Russia vanish like smoke, and let them perish like wax before the fire!”

*Stichos:* Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

Thou didst pour forth thy supplication to the Lord, O holy hierarch Hermogenes, and to Him didst thou declare thy grief, saying: “Behold, I lay down my life for my sheep! O Lord, accept it as incense of prayer for Orthodox Russia, that it may remain in holiness and the right Faith forever!”

*Stichos:* Thy priests shall be clothed in righteousness, and Thy righteous shall rejoice.

Cover us with thy supplications, O holy hierarch our father, and teach us to pray in Orthodox manner: “O Lord our Lord, save us before we perish utterly!”

Glory, in Tone I—

O all-praised martyr Hermogenes, even the earth could not conceal thee: for heaven received thee, and the gates of heaven have been opened unto thee; and, dwelling therein, thou delightest in the tree of life. Pray thou to Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.

Now & ever…, in the same tone—

While the holy hierarch Hermogenes standeth before the Mother of God, praying for Russia, we also fall down before the all-pure one, crying aloud: O all-holy Theotokos, help us!

At the Blessing of the Loaves, the troparion of the hieromartyr, in Tone IV—

O foremost hierarch of the Russian land and tireless advocate for it before God, laying down thy life for the Faith of Christ and thy flock, thou didst deliver thy land from ungodliness. Wherefore, we cry aloud unto thee: Save us by thy supplications, O hieromartyr Hermogenes our father! *Twice*

And “Virgin Theotokos, rejoice!…”, once.

AT MATINS

On “God is the Lord…”, the troparion of the saint, twice; Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion.

After the first chanting of the Psalter, these sessional hymns, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast appeared…”—

Assembling, O ye faithful, let us praise him who preserved Russia in days of turmoil, for he preached to our land the way of Orthodox stewardship and, boldly denouncing the ungodly authority of the usurper, was murdered by starvation in prison; and now, dwelling with the hieromartyrs, he prayeth that we be saved.

Glory…—

Celebrating thy holy memory today, we earnestly beseech thee to entreat the Lord and Savior, O hieromartyr Hermogenes, that He grant ­Orthodox confirmation to our laws.

Now & ever…: Theotokion—

O ye faithful, let us bless the Theotokos, our helper, the fervent aid of those amid misfortune, by whom we have been delivered from foreign bondage.

After the second chanting of the Psalter, these sessional hymns, in Tone IV: Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast appeared…”—

Thou hast appeared today to Orthodox Russia, and the light of thy good pleasure hath been signed upon us who chant unto thee with understanding: Thou hast come, thou hast appeared, an all-glorious wonder-worker!

Glory…—

O ye faithful, let us hasten to the relics of the holy hierarch Hermogenes, and let us pour forth our grief before him and declare to him our sorrow, that we may obtain great consolation; for none who believeth shall depart empty away.

Now & ever…—

Today the Mistress of the world rejoiceth, beholding the holy hierarch Hermogenes crowned with great power by Christ and ever praying for Orthodox Russia. Through his supplications, O Mother of God Most High, shelter us beneath the protection of thy goodness.

Polyeleos, and this magnification—

We magnify thee, O holy hieromartyr Hermogenes, and we reverence thine honored sufferings, which thou didst endure for Christ.

*Stichos:* What shall I render unto the Lord for all that He hath rendered unto me?

Let every breath praise the Lord.

Gospel according to Luke, § 67

\[Lk. 12: 32-40\]

The Lord said: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell what ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through. Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.”

After Psalm 50, this sticheron, in Tone VI—

O Hermogenes, thou wast shown to be a most fervent advocate for the Orthodox people, and, boldly rejecting heretical doctrine, didst show thyself to be a model of Orthodoxy for all, praying for all who follow thy divine teachings and instructions.

Canon of supplication to the Theotokos \[the Paraclysis\], with 6 troparia, including the irmos; and that of the hieromartyr, with 8 troparia, the acrostic whereof is: “Hear the voice of the holy hierarch Hermogenes, O land: ‘Holy Russia, beloved of God, shall not perish!’”, in Tone VIII—

Ode I

*Irmos:* O ye people, let us send up a hymn unto our wondrous God, Who freed Israel from bondage, singing and crying out a hymn of victory unto Thee Who alone art Master.

O ye who know jubilation, hymn and magnify the great holy hierarch, and, pondering his end, emulate his faith.

An abundance of grace resideth in the shrine of thy relics, O holy hierarch Hermogenes; wherefore, we glorify thee as a newly-manifest wonder-worker, and ask healings of thee.

The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, teaching thee also, O holy hierarch, to serve the Lord with trembling and rejoice before His countenance. By thy supplication grant that we also may make this a good beginning for ourselves.

Many are the tribulations of the righteous, and the Lord shall deliver them out of them all. Thy life was lived in accordance with these words, O holy hierarch. And, lo! thou now rejoicest in the heavens, and dost gladden all who honor thy memory.

Thou wast one searching out the testimonies of God, O holy hierarch, for thou didst study the law of Christ day and night. The judgments of the Lord are right, for the Lord hath caused thee to dwell in the habitations of the righteous.

Thou didst love the commandments of the Lord from thy youth, and the traditions of the holy fathers didst thou preserve until thy death, O holy hierarch; and together with them thou now renderest glory unto God. Him do thou beseech, that through thee He save our souls.

Him Whom thou didst love didst thou zealously serve; and thou now chantest with the choirs of the saints and prayest for us.

*Theotokion:* O fervent advocate, helper of the Christian race, accept the entreaties of us who earnestly invoke and pray to thee: Cover thou our Orthodox land with the protection of thy goodness.

Ode III

*Irmos:* Thou art the confirmation of those who have recourse to Thee, O Lord; Thou art the light of the benighted; and my spirit doth hymn Thee.

I have remembered years of old, and have pondered all thy works, O holy hierarch; I have found the knowledge of how to live in this world, being taught by the holy fathers and the lives of the saints.

Thou wast a wise bishop for the people, O holy hierarch, and wast like unto the man in the ancient chronicles who saw, as in a mirror, the face of the genesis of our Orthodox land, learning the wisdom of Orthodoxy in times of old.

O Lord our Lord, how wondrous is Thy name throughout all of Russia! The Lord holdeth our enemies in derision. The Lord is our helper. This truth didst thou commit to writing, O holy hierarch, teaching generations of generations, as the chronicler of Orthodox Russia.

Learn, O ye people! Ye people, feel compunction, expressing yourselves in the hymns and spiritual songs wherewith the holy hierarch Hermogenes glorified the Theotokos, the helper of our race.

Except the Lord build the house, in vain do they labor that build it. This truth didst thou impart to the guardians of our land, O holy hierarch, that their efforts prove not to be in vain, and that they not rise up to no effect.

Thou wast the priest of the church of the holy hierarch Nicholas, O Hermogenes, and, stirring up the gift which abode within thee, thou didst win the great love of the Mother of God, by whom thou wast led from glory to glory, even unto heaven, and hast come to dwell amid the mansions of the righteous.

Thou wast like unto the merchant who found a priceless pearl when thou didst remove the icon of the Mother of God from the earth like a treasure full of grace, which enricheth the poor in spirit.

*Theotokion:* The account of thy miracles, O Theotokos, which the holy hierarch Hermogenes wrote to the glory of thy Kazan’ icon, ever moveth all of Orthodox Russia to flee to thee amid every evil circumstance, and earnestly to pray: O all-holy Theotokos, help us!

Sessional hymn, in Tone VIII: Spec. Mel.: “Of the Wisdom…”—

Ascending to the summit of heaven, and having been illumined by an effulgence of miracles therefrom, O father, thou wast truly shown to be an all-radiant pastor for Orthodox Russia, and art for us an invincible intercessor amid perils. Wherefore, having all-gloriously vanquished our enemies, thou didst drive away the falsehood of heresy and save thine Orthodox land from destruction. Entreat Christ God, O Hermogenes, that He grant remission of sins unto those who with love honor thy holy memory.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion—

Emulating the holy hierarch Hermogenes, let us venerate the all-radiant icon of the Mother of God as an inexhaustible wellspring of healings, and let us bless the Mother of God Most High as the Virgin who, alone among women, gave birth to God in the flesh.

Ode IV

*Irmos:* I have heard, O Lord, the mystery of Thy dispensation; I have understood Thy works, and have glorified Thy divinity.

“Declare among the nations the works of God, which the Lord Almighty hath revealed to us through the icon of His Mother,” thou didst say, O holy hierarch, “that the heathen may not say: ‘Where is the God in Whom they believe?’, and that their mouths may be stopped!”

The icon of the all-pure one was embraced by the earth, yet was it not held fast, that it might serve to make steadfast the newly enlightened ones who were becoming lost in the darkness of ignorance, and to reveal the light of the truth, as the holy hierarch Hermogenes thought.

Thou art the excellent singer of the praises of the all-immaculate one! Thou art the confirmation of those who are weak in faith! Thou art the enlightenment of those benighted in the darkness of unbelief! And my spirit doth hymn thee!

Thou didst shoulder the easy and light burden, O Hermogenes, when thou didst receive the angelic habit, that thou mightest attain the stature of a perfect man.

Seeing Hermogenes to be a struggler for the virtues, arrayed in prayer as in a garment, the Monastery of the Savior rejoiced; for the sacred archimandrite came to restore the community and make piety steadfast.

As the namesake of Hermolaus thou didst reach maturity, and, living in community, thou becamest like unto Hermogenes. And, lo! like a lamp which faileth not in its light, thou wast set upon the lamp-stand of the Church of Kazan’.

Fitting is it for one who is all-wise to enlighten those who lack wisdom, for one who is strong to strengthen the weak; and meet was it for Hermogenes to become a bishop, making all strong in the Lord.

*Theotokion:* The holy Hermogenes hymned thee as the Lady, Queen and Mistress who helpeth all of us who have recourse to thy mighty protection. With him accept thou our entreaties, and save our souls.

Ode V

*Irmos:* Waking at dawn, we cry to Thee: Save us, O Lord! For Thou art our God, and we know none other than Thee.

When thou wast in the Kazan’, thou didst enlighten those who knew not the true God and didst teach them to labor for the one God. Wherefore, thou rejoicest with the apostles, receiving the reward of an evangelist of Christ.

With divine zeal thou didst emulate in glory Gurius, Barsanuphius and Germanus, who are wondrous among the saints, O Hermogenes, and assisted by their supplications, thou hast passed over to the habitations of the holy hierarchs, standing before the one Chief Shepherd, Whom do thou beseech, that we all be saved.

With mercy thou didst chastise, and in chastising thou didst show mercy, O holy hierarch; and with this wisdom thou didst protect thy newly-enlightened children and all thy sheep from the ravenous wolves.

Thou wast a bulwark of Orthodoxy, didst protect those who were weak in faith, and didst call upon Tsar Theodore to care for the salvation in Christ Jesus of his nation, showing forth the saving transfiguration of the land.

The city of Moscow, and with it all of Russia, wept bitterly when the usurper seized the throne; yet thou alone, as a mighty champion, didst stand against his impiety, and didst boldly confess the Orthodox Faith with boldness.

With hymns let us bless Hermogenes the confessor, who was undaunted by threats of death and the cruel words of the ungodly enemy.

Before Him upon Whom the ranks of the angels and all the saints gaze, rejoicing, thou now standest, O Hermogenes, and as a confessor thou dost ever mediate for Orthodox Russia.

*Theotokion:* O all-immaculate Virgin, thou restoration of Adam, the Lord is with thee, and through thee God is with us! Understand this, ye nations, and submit yourselves!

Ode VI

*Irmos:* Grant me a robe of light, O Thou Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, O most merciful Christ our God.

By the election of the sacred council and the will of God thou didst ascend the throne of patriarchal authority, O holy hierarch, that thou mightest save Russia which was beset by many perils.

With thine own hand, O holy hierarch, thou didst write a staunch confession of unadulterated Faith, and didst proclaim this Faith before the whole Church in the Cathedral of the Dormition of the all-pure one, that all Russia might see the rock of the true Faith, whereon it is founded and made steadfast in Orthodoxy.

Thy tongue was the pen of a swiftly writing scribe, whereby the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceiver were stopped, and the tumult of the ungodly was quelled.

Dispelling the darkness of falsehood with the word of truth, and blessing the Orthodox army to do battle with the traitors, thou didst bear the wonder-working relics of the Tsarevich Demetrius through the streets of Moscow, that the truth of God might be known and the Orthodox land might be strengthened.

“If ye repent, ye shall be saved, and the Russian land will be strengthened by the power of God,” thou didst say, O holy hierarch.

At the throne of grace thou wast like a tree by springs of water, overshadowing Orthodox Russia with the coolness of consolation and the fruits of righteousness.

O holy hierarch, thou didst preach, reprove, summon, pray and command that prayers be said in all the temples for the salvation and pacification of the Orthodox land.

*Theotokion:* O Virgin Theotokos, thou hope of Christians, protect, preserve, keep and save Russia, which hath recourse to thine aid.

Kontakion, in Tone VI—

Wasting away in imprisonment and starvation, thou didst remain faithful even unto death, O blessed Hermogenes, driving faintheartedness from the hearts of thy people and calling all to the common struggle. Wherefore, thou didst set at nought the rebellion of the ungodly and make our land steadfast, that all might cry out to thee: Rejoice, O helper of the Russian land!

*Ikos:* Come, O ye Orthodox people, and with hymns let us bless the all-radiant luminary of the Church of Russia, the unshakable pillar of the Orthodox Faith, the fervent advocate and intercessor for our land, the mighty opponent of the enemy, the stern denouncer of the traitors and destroyers of the Orthodox land, the good pastor who laid down thy life for thy sheep, who thus was crowned by the Lord with a wreath of glory; and let us fall down before him, crying out thus with faith and love: Rejoice, O our father Hermogenes, High priest of Christ who art great among the hierarchs of Russia!

Ode VII

*Irmos:* In Babylon, the pious youths did not worship the golden image, but, bedewed in the midst of the fiery furnace, they chanted a hymn, saying: O supremely exalted God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

Burning with the fire of cruel malice, Orthodox Russia was like unto a fiery furnace in the days of destruction and grievous sedition; yet, bedewed by the power of thy words, O holy hierarch, even to this day it chanteth in Orthodox manner: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

Hermogenes, the holy hierarch of God, was shown to be the father of all Russia in the days of sorrow and evil circumstances; wherefore, summon him and with him chant unto the name of the Most High: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!

“Pray ye and fast, and transform yourselves into new men, clothed in the virtue of the love of God and piety, that the Lord may grant peace and love to us all, mighty unity to our land, and victory and triumph over the enemy to our nation.”

Warmed with love for thy homeland and burning with zeal for the Faith more than fire, O holy hierarch, thou didst consume the thorns of sin-loving sedition, restoring and making steadfast a life which had grown old.

Fat bulls — seditious usurpers, foreign rulers and ungodly traitors — surrounded Russia; yet when confronted by thy righteousness, O holy hierarch, they vanished like smoke before the face of fire, that Orthodox Russia might rejoice in the Lord, and that Orthodoxy might triumph.

The holy hierarchs of Christ—Philaret of Rostov, Ephraim of Kazan’, Theoctistus of Tver’ and Galacteon of Suzdal’—were thy godly laborers and helpers, through whom thy words were sent forth to all the earth and thy sound unto the ends of Russia, O holy hierarch Hermogenes.

*Theotokion:* O ye who amid perils, sorrows and sickness are weighed down by many sins, come ye to the fervent helper, the Mother of the Lord Most High; for she shall heal and comfort, and bring thee peace.

Ode VIII

*Irmos:* Trampling down the fire and flame in the furnace, the divinely eloquent youths did chant: Bless the Lord, O ye works of the Lord!

Many alms didst thou give to the people, O holy hierarch, when the rich were lacking in mercy and in their avarice neglected to help the poor; and when thou didst speak to Abramius, the cellarer of the Lavra of Saint Sergius, the granaries were opened: the people were fed, and they blessed the Lord.

“Even though the sea of life doth foam, even though it is lashed to fury by the tempest of dangers, yet doth the ship of Christ not sink; for we stand upon the rock of Faith and righteousness!” Thus didst thou say, O holy hierarch, and thus was it so. And, lo! the Orthodox celebrate and bless the Lord.

Like a good helmsman didst thou guide the ship of Russia to the calm harbor of the Orthodox Church, O holy hierarch; and, lo! our land is seasoned with the grace of the Holy Spirit and blesseth the Lord.

O holy hierarch, thou didst say to those who fear the Lord: “Fear not, little flock, for it hath been the good pleasure of the heavenly Father to grant us victory over the enemy, and peace!” Thus didst thou believe, and thus didst thou receive according to thy faith. And, lo! the Holy Church rejoiceth in the Orthodoxy of our land and blesseth the Lord.

They who rose up against thee mocked thee, casting dust and sand in thy face, thinking that thou wouldst pose no threat to the traitors and rebels; yet thou didst endure it all for righteousness’ sake, blessing the Lord.

“Holy Russia, which is beloved of God, shall not perish!” thou didst say to the traitors, betrayers and all our enemies, O holy hierarch; “If the Lord doth not build, in vain do ye labor! Repent and bless ye the Lord!”

“We know not what to call you,” thou didst say to the rebels and traitors, O holy hierarch; “Ye have apostatized from God, have fallen away from the catholic and apostolic Church; ye have forgotten the vows of our Orthodox Faith: to stand until death for the house of the all-holy Theotokos, for the Orthodox Faith and the fatherland! Repent and convert, and bless ye the Lord!”

*Theotokion:* Fulfilling the dispensation of God concerning us, and uniting those on earth to those in heaven, through the Holy Spirit thou didst conceive in thy womb, O all-immaculate one, and gavest birth for us to the God of all, Whom all the works of the Lord hymn and exalt supremely for all ages.

Ode IX

*Irmos:* Saved by thee, O pure Virgin, we confess thee to be in truth the Theotokos, magnifying thee with the incorporeal choirs.

To the all-pure Mistress didst thou entrust the Orthodox army, O holy hierarch, and didst bless them to stand immovably for the Faith even unto death; and thou didst teach them to fear Him alone Who dwelleth in the heavens. Wherefore, thou rejoicest with the confessors of the truth of Orthodoxy.

Thou didst anathematize the accursed traitors, O holy hierarch, and didst impart to the Orthodox warriors and all lovers of Orthodoxy mercy from the Lord God and from thine own humility, and thereby was victory and triumph gained over the enemy, and salvation for all Russia; and God bestowed on thee a crown, as to the architect of the life of holiness.

The voice of fiery zeal for the salvation of the homeland cannot be restrained even when enclosed in a bare cell, as in a grave; wherefore, thou didst command thy disciple, the Abbot Dionysius, and the monks of the Lavra of Saint Sergius to issue a call to all of Orthodox Russia, that a war of salvation be waged for the glory of the Holy Church and to make steadfast the land of Russia, which thou didst love, and for which thou prayest to God.

Thou wast a primate of the Church of the apostles, a confessor of the Orthodox Faith, a second Chrysostom in denouncing the seditious and those who love sin, and the steward of the Orthodox land, O holy hierarch; and for this thou wast tortured with imprisonment and starvation, and, receiving from God an imperishable crown, thou rejoicest with the martyrs.

Glory to God for thee, O hieromartyr Hermogenes! For thee it is enough to rejoice in the light of His countenance, and to pray unceasingly that Holy Russia not perish, but that it be until the end a light of the revelation of Orthodox righteousness for the nations.

Poor and ailing am I, O holy hierarch, and in my low estate I fall down before thy healing relics, asking healing.

Thou didst love Him to Whom thou didst surrender thy soul, and standest now before Him with boldness as a martyr. Entreat God in our behalf, O holy hieromartyr Hermogenes.

*Theotokion:* Thee do we confess as the Mother of the Lord Most High, and, placing unwavering trust in thee, we beseech thee with compunctionate soul and contrite heart: Grant unto all that which is profitable, and save us all, O Virgin Theotokos, for thou art the divine protection of thy servants.

Exapostilarion: Spec. Mel.: “Hearken, ye women…”—

In the light of the Orthodoxy, which thou didst love, O holy hierarch Hermogenes, we behold the light of Truth, wherein is the fullness of the gifts of the Spirit. We rejoice in the Lord, and magnify thee who shinest with the light of eternal life.

Glory…, Now & ever…: Theotokion—

With hymns let us magnify as more radiant than the armies on high the Mother of the never-waning Light, who hath made Russia splendid with the protecting veil of her maternal aid.

Rejoice, O power which healeth us! Rejoice, O understanding which enlighteneth us! Rejoice, O guardian preserving our Orthodoxy! Rejoice, O holy hierarch Hermogenes!

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same tone—

Come, let us praise the all-praised one, who is more glorious than all mortals and Higher in honor than the armies of heaven: the Mother of the Lord Most High, our fervent helper!

Prokimenon, in Tone VII—

The righteous man shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in Him.

*Stichos:* Hearken, O God, unto my prayer, when I make supplication unto Thee.

Epistle to the Hebrews, § 335 \(13: 17-21\)

Brethren: Obey those who have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as ones who must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. Now the God of peace, Who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Alleluia, in Tone IV—

*Stichos:* Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy righteous shall rejoice.

*Stichos:* For the Lord hath elected Sion, He hath chosen her to be a habitation for Himself.

Gospel according to John, § 36 \(10:9-16\).

The Lord said to the Jews who came to Him: “I am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good Shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down My life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”

Communion Verse—

In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings.
