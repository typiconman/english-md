THE SECOND SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST

SERVICE TO ALL THE SAINTS WHO HAVE SHONE FORTH IN THE RUSSIAN LAND

On the first Sunday after the commemoration of All Saints, which is the first Sunday of the Fast of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, we celebrate the memory of all the saints who have shone forth in the land of Russia.

AT LITTLE VESPERS:

On “Lord, I have cried...”, 4 stichera of the resurrection, in Tone I; and Glory…, in Tone VI —

The memory of the saints hath been shown to be a cause of great festivity for our land; and, boasting therein, let us say: Forget not your native land of Russia, but be ye mindful of all of us who keep your memory, O all ye saints, praying to the Lord in our behalf.

Now & ever...: Theotokion, in Tone I.

At the Aposticha, one sticheron of the resurrection, in Tone I; and these stichera of the saints, in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: “Joy of the ranks of heaven...” —

*Stichos:* The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them.

Let us all pray to Christ, celebrating today the memory of the glorious Vladimir, the author of the enlightenment of the Russian land; and with him let us harmoniously hymn our divine fathers, saying unto them: O all ye saints, entreat the Lord in our behalf, that He grant us great mercy!

*Stichos:* Blessed are all those who fear the Lord, that walk in His ways.

Rejoice, thou mountain of the Caves most rich, curdled by the Spirit! Rejoice, O paradise of immortal delights; for within thee hath our God been well pleased ever to dwell, enriching thee with the torrents of wonders which thou dost pour forth through His venerable ones!

Glory…, in Tone I —

With spiritual songs let us all cry out: Rejoice and be glad, O city of Kiev, who hast presented us with the all-rich Olga! Rejoice, thou city of Suzdal’, who hast given rise to the right-believing Euphrosynia, a fruit of the tree of paradise, the confirmation of fasters! And with them let us also bless the all-glorious Febronia of Murom, Anna of Kashin, and Euphrosynia, the adornment of the land of Polotsk, and all the women of the Russian land who have been pleasing unto God; and let us cry out to them: O most blessed and holy ones, pray ye to the Lord in our behalf, that He grant us great mercy!

Now & ever …: Theotokion, in the same tone —

The prophet called thee the cloud of the everlasting Light, O Virgin; for Christ our God, the Word of the Father, Who shone forth from thee like the dew upon the fleece, hath enlightened the world and abolished deception. We beseech thee, O all-pure one: Cease thou never earnestly to entreat Him in behalf of us who confess thee to be the true Theotokos.

After “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart…”, Trisagion through Our Father, and the Troparion of the Resurrection; Glory…: that of the saints, in Tone VIII —

The land of Russia doth offer Thee, O Lord, all the saints who have shone forth in it, as the beauteous fruit of Thy salvific splendor. By their supplications and through the Theotokos preserve Thou the Church and our land in peace profound, O most Merciful One.

Now & ever…: Theotokion, in the same Tone —

O Good One, Who for our sake wast born of the Virgin and, having endured crucifixion, cast down death by death, and as God revealed the resurrection: disdain not that which Thou hast fashioned with Thine own hand. Show forth Thy love for mankind, O Merciful One; accept the Theotokos who gave Thee birth and prayeth for us; and save Thy despairing people, O our Savior!

AT GREAT VESPERS:

After the Introductory Psalm, we chant “Blessed is the man…”, the full kathisma.

On “Lord, I have cried…”, we chant 10 stichera: 4 for the resurrection, in Tone I, and 6 of the saints —

*In Tone I:* Come, ye assemblies of Russia, let us praise the saints that are in our land — the venerable, the holy hierarchs, the right-believing princes, the martyrs, hieromartyrs, the fools for Christ’s sake, and the company of holy women — both those known by name and those unknown; for truly by their deeds and words, and their manifold ways of life, and through the gifts of God, they became saints, and God hath glorified even their graves with miracles. And now, standing directly before Christ Who hath glorified them, they pray fervently in behalf of us who celebrate their splendid festival with love.

*In Tone II:* With what beauties of hymnody shall we praise the divinely wise hierarchs of Russia, the splendid adornment of the Church of Christ, the crown of the priesthood, the rule of piety, the inexhaustible wellsprings of divine healing, the outpouring of the gifts of the Spirit, the rivers of manifold miracles which gladden the land of Russia with their flow, the fervent helpers of pious folk, for whose sake Christ, Who hath great mercy, hath cast down the uprisings of the enemy.

*In Tone VIII:* Earth is glad and heaven rejoiceth, O venerable fathers, praising your feats and labors, your spiritual fortitude and purity of mind; for ye were not overcome by the law of nature. O holy company and divine assembly, ye are truly the confirmation of our land.

*In the same tone: Spec. Mel.: “O most glorious wonder…”* — O blessed and divinely wise princes of Russia, who shine forth with Orthodox loving-kindness and are resplendent with the brilliance of the virtues: Ye illumine all the faithful, driving away the darkness of the demons. Wherefore, we honor you as partakers of never-waning grace and unashamed preservers of your heritage, O right wondrous ones.

O all-blessed martyrs of Christ, ye gave yourselves over to voluntary sacrifice, have sanctified the land of Russia with your blood, and have brought splendor even unto the air by your repose; and now ye dwell in the heavens amid never-waning light, ever praying in our behalf, O beholders of God.

The corrections of your virtues have enlightened the hearts of the faithful, O fools for Christ’s sake and ye righteous, who have shone forth in Russia; for who hath heard of your boundless humility and forbearance, and doth not marvel? The needs of all did ye anticipate, O right-wondrous ones: ye were an example of meekness and guilelessness for all, of pity for the sorrowful, of speedy aid to those in misfortune, an untroubled haven for those at sea, and good speed for travellers. And now ye have been crowned with unfading wreaths by the hand of the omnipotent God. Him do ye entreat, that our souls be saved.

Glory…, in Tone V —

Rejoice, O faithful realm of Russia! Rejoice, O right-believing Prince Vladimir most rich! Rejoice, O chosen Olga! For ye were our first mediators before the Master of all, the initiators of Orthodoxy, and guides to the True Faith! Rejoice, every place and land and city nurtured by the citizens of the kingdom of heaven! These saints have been shown to be beacons for our souls! With the radiance of miracles, and by deeds and signs, they have shone forth mystically upon all the ends of the earth. And they now entreat Christ for the salvation of our souls.

Now & ever…: the Dogmatic Theotokion in the tone of the week.

Entrance. Prokimenon: “The Lord is King…” Three readings —

A Reading from the Prophecy of Isaiah

All the nations are gathered together, and princes shall be gathered out of them. Who will declare these things, or who will let them bring forth their witnesses, and be justified; and let them hear, and declare the truth? Be ye My witnesses, and I too am a witness, saith the Lord God, and My servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know, and believe, and understand that I am he: before Me there was no other God, and after Me there shall be none. I am God; and beside Me there is no Savior. I have declared, and have saved; I have reproached, and there was no strange god among you. Ye are My witnesses, and I am the Lord God, even from the beginning: and there is none that can deliver out of My hands. I will work, and who shall turn it back? Thus saith the Lord God Who redeemeth you, the Holy One of Israel.

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath He tried them and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign forever. Those who put their trust in Him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with Him: for grace and mercy is to His saints, and He hath care for His elect.

A Reading from the Wisdom of Solomon

The righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the Most High. Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with His right hand shall He cover them, and with His arm shall He protect them. He shall take to Him His jealousy for complete armor, and make the creature His weapon for the revenge of His enemies. He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment instead of a helmet. He shall take holiness for an invincible shield. His severe wrath shall He sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with Him against the unwise. Then shall the right- aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow, shall they fly to the mark. And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stone bow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them. Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty. Hear, therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations. For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Most High.

At the Litia, the sticheron of the temple, and these stichera of the saints, in Tone VIII —

Rejoice with us, all ye choirs of saints and ranks of angels, spiritually gathered together; and let us come and chant a hymn of thanksgiving unto Christ our God. For, lo! the countless assembly of our kinsmen, who have been well-pleasing unto God, standeth before the King of glory, and with entreaty mediateth for us. They are the pillars and beauty of the Orthodox Faith; they have glorified the Church of God with their ascetic feats and the shedding of their blood, with their teachings and deeds; they have confirmed the Faith of Christ with miracles and signs; they have shone forth from all the regions of our land, have established the Orthodox Faith therein, and with apostolic zeal have brought it even unto other lands. Others have adorned the wilderness and the cities with holy monasteries, manifesting an angelic life. Many have been subjected to trials through mockery, wounding and cruel death by the children of this age. And many have struggled in other ways, in every class. And all pray to the Lord, that He deliver our homeland from tribulations, and provide us with a model of patience and endurance in the face of evil.

Glory..., Now & ever…: in the same tone —

All the noetic ranks rejoice with us, joining in spiritual chorus. They have seen the Queen and Mistress of all, glorified by the faithful with many names. And all the souls of the righteous, beholders of the sight, rejoice to see her in the air, stretching forth her most precious hands in supplication, entreating peace for the world, confirmation for the land of Russia, and salvation for our souls.

At the Aposticha, the stichera of the Resurrection, in the tone of the week; and Glory…, in Tone IV —

Celebrating the yearly commemoration of our holy kinsmen, let us call them blessed, as is meet; for they have truly passed through all the beatitudes of the Lord: impoverished, they have become rich in spirit; being meek, they have inherited the land of the meek; having wept, they have found comfort; having thirsted after righteousness, they have been filled; having had mercy upon others, they have themselves found mercy ; pure of heart, they have seen God, as far as such is possible; peace-makers, they have been counted worthy of adoption by God; and persecuted and tormented for piety and righteousness’ sake, they now rejoice and are glad in the heavens; and they earnestly entreat the Lord, that He have pity on our homeland.

Now & ever...: Theotokion, in Tone V —

Let us sound the clarion of hymns! Together let us chant unto the Theotokos and Queen, the helper of our land: Rejoice, O thou who from ages past hast crowned our homeland with thy benevolence and pourest forth thy grace thereon! Wherefore, our Church of Russia doth celebrate with splendor thine all-honored protecting veil and the memory of thy miracles wrought thereby. Take not thy mercy away from us now, O Mistress; but look down upon our sorrows and oppression, and raise us up by thy mighty assistance.

After the blessing of the loaves, we chant: “O Virgin Theotokos, rejoice…”, thrice; and the troparion of the saints, once, in Tone VIII —

The land of Russia doth offer Thee, O Lord, all the saints who have shone forth in it, as the beauteous fruit of Thy salvific splendor. By their supplications and through the Theotokos preserve Thou the Church and our land in peace profound, O most Merciful One.

AT MATINS

At “God is the Lord…”, the troparion of the resurrection, twice; Glory…, the troparion of the saints; Now & ever…: the Theotokion:

O Good One, Who for our sake wast born of the Virgin and, having endured crucifixion, cast down death by death, and as God revealed the resurrection: disdain not that which Thou hast fashioned with Thine own hand. Show forth Thy love for mankind, O Merciful One; accept the Theotokos who gave Thee birth and prayeth for us; and save Thy despairing people, O our Savior!

After the kathismata, the sessional hymns of the resurrection, in the tone of the week, with their stichoi and theotokia.

On the Praises, 4 stichera of the Resurrection, and 4 of the saints —

*In Tone I:* Thou didst send Thy Spirit, O Lord, to the wise soul of Prince Vladimir, that he might know Thee, the one God in Trinity. Wherefore, having enlightened Thy chosen people, entrusted to him by Thee, Thou broughtest them into Thy Church with faith, chanting: O our Deliverer, glory be to Thee!

*In Tone II:* Assembling together, let us bless the beacons of the land of Russia, the all-praised martyrs, the holy hierarchs, our enlighteners and the foundation of our faith, the venerable dwellers in the wilderness and instructors in piety, crying out to them: O ye venerable, ye martyrs, ye righteous, and all ye saints of Russia, entreat Christ God, that He grant us great mercy!

*Stichos:* The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them.

O venerable fathers, the spiritual blossoms of the Russian land, our boast and confirmation, and a right calm haven for all were ye; for, having acquired you as an inexhaustible treasure, our land doth boast in you. And now, even though your bodily tongues have fallen silent, yet do miracles bear witness that the Lord hath glorified you. Him do ye entreat, that He grant our souls great mercy.

*Stichos:* Blessed are those who fear the Lord, that walk in His ways.

*In Tone IV:* Having listened to the voice of the Gospel and become enflamed with apostolic zeal, ye made haste to teach the unbelieving heathen, O divinely blessed Kuksha, Leontius, Stephen and Gurius, equals of the apostles, and thou, O right-wondrous Innocent, apostle of the great land of Siberia and initiator of the enlightenment of the new lands beyond the sea. Wherefore, as is meet, with all the others who have labored in spreading the Gospel of Christ, ye are called blessed.

Glory…, the Evangelical Sticheron. Now & ever…: Theotokion: All-blessed art thou, O Virgin Theotokos…

Great Doxology. And after the Trisagion, the troparion of the resurrection alone.

AT LITURGY:

On the Beatitudes, 10 troparia: 6 of the tone of the week; and 4 of the saints, in Tone IV —

We have not inherited our land through the sword, but through Thy right hand, and Thine upraised arm, and the light of Thy countenance; and by the tears of Thy saints, their struggles and sweat, their blood and teaching, is our homeland firmly established.

When we turned away from Thee and did not keep Thy commandments, then didst Thou thrust us aside and cast us down; and we have become the least among all the nations. But have pity on us, O God our Savior, through the entreaties of the saints.

*Glory…:* *Triadicon:* O all-blessed Trinity, return us from exile; heal our sickness and our sorrow; and lift our spirit from slothfulness and the sleep of sin, that we may be worthy of our fathers and brethren who by their struggles glorified Thy name in our land.

*Now & ever…:* *Theotokion:* Gather in the dispersed, return those who have been cut off, bring back again those who have fallen away from the Orthodox Faith, comfort the weeping and sorrowful, and heal the dissolution of our tormented land, O thou who art full of grace, entreating God in our behalf with the saints who are our compatriots.

After the Little Entrance, the troparion of the Resurrection, that of the temple, if dedicated to the Theotokos, and that of the saints. Kontakion of the Resurrection; Glory…: that of the saints; Now & ever…: that of the temple, if dedicated to the Theotokos; or, O intercession for Christians unashamed…

Prokimenon of the tone of the week; and that of the saints, in Tone VII —

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

Epistle, as appointed; and that of the saints: Hebrews § 330 \[Heb. 11: 33-12: 2\].

Brethren: By faith all the saints subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions. Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; \(of whom the world was not worthy:\) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith.

Alleluia, in Tone I —

*Stichos:* O God, Thou givest avengement unto me and hast subdued peoples under me.

*Stichos:* Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, ye righteous.

Gospel, as appointed; and that of the saints: Matthew § 10 \[Mt. 4: 25-5: 12\].

At that time, there followed Jesus great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from beyond ­Jordan. And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain: and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they who mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in the heavens: for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.”

Communion Verse —

Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous; praise is meet for the upright.

.

N.B.: If the church be dedicated to All Saints of Russia, at Matins we chant: Having beheld the Resurrection of Christ…; and Psalm 50. Glory…: Through the prayers of all the saints of Russia, O Merciful One…; Now & ever…: Through the prayers of the Theotokos…

And instead of Jesus having risen from the dead…, we chant the sticheron: Celebrating the yearly commemoration… \(the first of the aposticha stichera at Great Vespers\); and the rest as usual.
